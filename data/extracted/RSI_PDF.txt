When we conducted a literature analysis of many papers,
we found that similar types of studies had been conducted
on the RSI subject. Various authors have addressed the
use of RSI indicators on stock charts and conducted a
comparative study. Additionally, the authors utilized other Fig.2:(AddingRSIindicatortochart)(https://in.tradingview.com

applying RSI to the chart and figure produces the default

The RSI’s default settings include a 14-period length and
an upper and lower band of 70, and We will change the
parameters in this method and see an example of how to
apply this strategy in practice. In this approach, the length
will remain constant; the only change will be in the values
ofthelowerandupperbands.Insteadoftheexistingvalues,
the new lower and upper bands will have values of 50 and
50, respectively. We will apply these strategies on weakly

the parameters for the lower and upper bands will be

50 we will apply these strategies in a weakly time frame
of NIFTY 50. We’ll now examine how to use the 60-40
