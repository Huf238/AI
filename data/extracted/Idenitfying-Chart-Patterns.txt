Defining Patterns
• A pattern is bounded by at least two trend lines (straight or curved)
• All patterns have a combination of entry and exit points
• Patterns can be continuation patterns or reversal patterns
• Patterns are fractal, meaning that they can be seen in any charting
period (weekly, daily, minute, etc.)
• A pattern is not complete or activated until an actual breakout occurs

BROKERAGE: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
The Limits of Patterns
Keep in Mind
Some of our human tendencies can be
dangerous for investors.
• See patterns where there aren’t any
• Believe “market lore,” technical and fundamental, without evidence
• Look backwards rather than forward
• Stick with original price targets of patterns after conditions have
changed

General Information about a Candlestick
Characteristics:
• Traditionally, candlestick patterns are reversal patterns, meaning they
are used to identify when a trend is ending
• Candlestick patterns are often used with longer-term trends, thus,
upward reversal patterns after a correction in a longer upward trend
show the best performance, and vice versa for downward reversal
patterns in a long downward trend
• Be careful not to act on a perceived candle pattern until the pattern
has formed and is activated by a breakout in a certain direction
32

[Page 34]
BROKERAGE: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Doji
Characteristics:
Doji
• A one-candle pattern formed when the open
and close are the same price, and the high
and low are roughly equidistant from the open
and close
• Extremely common
• Indicates indecision in the marketplace and
thus is a possible warning of price change

Harami
Characteristics:
Harami
• A two-candle pattern of a large body of either
Top Bottom
color followed by a small body of the opposite
color; The second body is completely within
the body of the large body and is called a
“spinning top”
• Although common belief is that the harami is
a reversal pattern, many report that is has the
potential of breaking either way
• A variation that has a doji instead of a spinning
top as the second candle has equally average
performance and random breakout*
Candle body can
be Black or White

Hanging Man and Hammer
Characteristics:
Hanging Man — Hammer
• One-candle patterns differentiated by the color
Top Bottom
of the body. Each pattern has a high that
coincides with either the opening or closing
price
• Hanging man, thought to be a continuation
pattern, actually breaks in either direction
randomly with a slight upward bias. Its overall
performance is below average*
• Hammers occur relatively frequently but have
below-average performance*

Shooting Star and Inverted Hammer
Characteristics: Shooting Star and
Inverted Hammer
• A one-candle inverted hanging man or hammer Top Bottom
pattern. Hammers by themselves have white
bodies and shooting stars have black bodies
• As a one-candle pattern, the shooting star has

single inverted hammer*

Engulfing
Characteristics:
Engulfing
• A two-bar pattern in which the second bar Top Bottom
body completely engulfs the first bar body*
• A bottom engulfing pattern, with a short black
body followed by a tall white body, is thought
to be an upward reversal pattern and actually
has very good performance on a downward
breakout in a downward trend*

Dark Cloud Cover and Piercing Line
Characteristics: Dark Cloud Cover
and Piercing Line
• The dark cloud cover is a two-bar pattern where Top Bottom
the second bar closes higher than the first and
is black versus white in the first bar
• The piercing line is the opposite of the dark
cloud cover in that the second bar is white and
lower than the first bar which is black
• The dark cloud is thought to be a downward
reversing pattern
• The piercing line pattern is thought to be an
upward reversing pattern*

variations of the same pattern
• These patterns are often preceded by
a steep, sharp price change, up or

down, and form a short consolidation
that appears like a triangle or flag.

Gaps
Characteristics
• Definition – no trading (gap)
at specific prices
• Gaps can be considered
“up” or “down”
• Gaps are caused by
appreciable changes
in supply and demand
from one close to the
following open
Gap Up

[Page 42]
BROKERAGE: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Gaps
Characteristics
• Gaps are generally profitable on
breakouts from patterns, trends,
support or resistance
• A method of trading a gap is the
“explosion gap pivot.” It assures
Breakout
that the gap is valid
• After the gap, wait for
“throwback.” If throwback “covers”
the gap, no action. If the
throwback stops, this is called the
“pivot low.” Place buy entry above
high of the gap bar
Gap PPivivoot tL Looww
• “Pivot” is the lowest level of the
post-gap breakout
• Protective stops initially placed at
gap low and then below pivot low

Two-Bar Reversal Button or Pipe Bottom
Two-Day Reversal Bottom
Characteristics:
(or Pipe Bottom)
• Two bars and occurs at the end of a large
trend, up or down trend. Ideally, the first bar,
in a bottom pattern, closes at the low, and the
second bar closes in the upper half of the range.
It is more reliable in weekly data
• Bar ranges are larger than preceding
bar ranges
• Action occurs on breakout through second bar
Calculate target price:
Take the height from the taller of the two bars to the lower
of the two bars. Add that amount to the taller of the two
bars to get a price target.

Volatility Patterns
Characteristics:
Inside Bar
• Dull activity is known as “low volatility.” New
trends often begin from periods of low volatility
Buy next bar
at opening
above inside
• One way to look at volatility is to observe the
bar close
relationship between price bars
• “Range” is the spread between high and low in
a price bar
• If a bar is followed by a bar with less range,
volatility is declining; the second bar is called a Sell next bar
at opening
“narrow range” bar
below inside
bar close
• When this second bar’s range is contained
within the range of its preceding bar, it is called
an “inside bar.”
43 *Source: Technical Analysis: the Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians, 2nd ed.

[Page 45]
BROKERAGE: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Narrow Range
Characteristics:
NR4
• One low volatility pattern is called a “Narrow
Range” pattern and consists of a bar with a
Range on day 4 less
range narrower than its preceding bars
than days 1-3
• The graph shows a four-bar, Narrow Range
pattern (NR4) with four bars, the fourth bar
having a narrower range than the preceding Buy
three bars
• The breakout occurs on a break above or below
the high or low of the narrow range
Sell

Important Information
Any screenshots, charts, or company trading symbols mentioned are provided for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered
an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for the security.
Investing involves risk, including risk of loss.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results
Stop loss orders do not guarantee the execution price you will receive and have additional risks that may be compounded in periods of
market volatility. Stop loss orders could be triggered by price swings and could result in an execution well below your trigger price.
Trailing stop orders may have increased risks due to their reliance on trigger pricing, which may be compounded in periods of market
volatility, as well as market data and other internal and external system factors. Trailing stop orders are held on a separate, internal order
file, place on a "not held" basis and only monitored between 9:30 AM and 4:00 PM Eastern.
Technical analysis focuses on market action – specifically, volume and price. Technical analysis is only one approach to analyzing stocks.
When considering which stocks to buy or sell, you should use the approach that you're most comfortable with. As with all your investments,
you must make your own determination as to whether an investment in any particular security or securities is right for you based on your
investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial situation. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
