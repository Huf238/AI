Throughout this book I give you the information to rewire your brain and\nthink in a slightly different way about the markets and how your trading fits into\nwhat’s happening at any time during the trading day. More important, the rewir-\ning also includes how the market is affecting your trading and how you can turn\nthis knowledge into your advantage. And no, rewiring your brain doesn’t hurt. But\nit does help you to see the markets in a different and more profitable way.\nChapter 7 is an excellent rewiring chapter.\nKeep these points in mind about the rewiring process:\n» Options trading, as all types of trading, is an adversarial process — a\nfight if you will. In other words, whomever or whatever is on the other side\nof your trade has one goal in mind: to take your money. Of course, whether\nyou realize it or not, you have the same goal. After all, unlike central banks\nthat create money out of thin air, trading profits for one side come at the\nexpense of trading losses for the other side.\n» Trading algorithms dominate the market, making trades lightning fast.",

Here are three of particular interest:\n» Parabolic stop-and-reverse model: Invented by Welles Wilder, the parabolic\nconcept is easy to illustrate and hard to describe. The principle is to create an\nindicator that rises by a factor of the average true range (see Chapter 7) as\nnew highs are being recorded, so that the indicator accelerates as ever-higher\nhighs are met and decelerates as less-high highs come in. In an uptrend, the\nindicator is plotted just below the price line. It diverges from the price line in a\nhot rally and converges to the price line",
    "output": "as the rally loses speed as in Figure 5-1.\nThe parabolic stop is both self-adjusting and trailing — a rare combination.\n» Average true-range stop: This stop is set just beyond the maximum nor-\nmal range limits. I describe the average true-range channel in greater detail\nin Chapter 14. With this stop, you take the average daily high-low range of\nthe price bars, adjusted for gaps, and expand it by adding on a constant,\nlike 25 percent of the range. Say your average daily trading range is $3. If\nthe price goes more than 25 percent beyond the $3 high-low range, you\nconsider it an extreme price and the signal to exit. The average true-range\nstop has the virtue of being self-adjusting, but it also has the drawback of\nsetting a stop that has nothing to do with your entry.\n» Chandelier exit: This stop solves the entry-level issue. Invented by Chuck\nLeBeau, the chandelier exit sets the stop at a level below the highest high\nor the highest close since your entry. You set the level as a function of the\naverage true range. The logic is that you’re willing to lose only one range\nworth (or two or three) from the best price that occurred since you put on the\ntrade. Like the parabolic stop, the chandelier is both self-adjusting and trailing.\n92 PART 1 Getting Started with Technical Analysis",

These professional traders make\nmoney in several ways. One of the most common is through trading with retail\ninvestors (that’s what market makers call you and us, the individual investors par-\nticipating in market trading activity). Market makers buy shares from a retail\ninvestor at one price and then turn around and sell those shares to another retail\ninvestor at a higher price. They buy at what is referred to as the bid price and then\nsell at what is referred to as the ask price. In addition to facilitating smooth market\ntrading activity, the goal of market makers is to sell for a price higher than they\nbuy, thus generating a profit.\nA market order tells your broker to buy or sell at the current market price. This\nmeans that if you use a market order when buying, your order is likely to be filled\nat the ask price. When selling, your market order is likely to be filled at the bid\nprice.

    "context": "ts to make more sense. These professional traders make\nmoney in several ways. One of the most common is through trading with retail\ninvestors (that’s what market makers call you and us, the individual investors par-\nticipating in market trading activity). Market makers buy shares from a retail\ninvestor at one price and then turn around and sell those shares to another retail\ninvestor at a higher price. They buy at what is referred to as the bid price and then\nsell at what is referred to as the ask price. In addition to facilitating smooth market\ntrading activity, the goal of market makers is to sell for a price higher than they\nbuy, thus generating a profit.\nA market order tells your broker to buy or sell at the current market price. This\nmeans that if you use a market order when buying, your order is likely to be filled\nat the ask price. When selling, your market order is likely to be filled at the bid\nprice. Occasionally, your broker may be able to fill your order between the bid and\nask prices, but you should never count on it because it doesn’t happen very often.\nYour order can, however, become the highest bid or the lowest ask if you use a\nlimit order.

A day trade is defined as entering and exiting a single position in the\nsame day. You can buy a stock and sell it or you can short a stock and cover the\nposition. Either way, if both transactions occur on the same day, it’s considered a\nday trade. If you day trade four or more times within a five-business-day period,\nyou’re classified as a pattern day trader unless your day trades represent fewer than\n6 percent of the total number of trades executed during the same period, which is\na huge threshold. After you’re classified as a pattern day trader, your account\nmust have at least $25,000 of equity before you’re permitted to execute additional\nday trades. Day trading margin rules are discussed in Chapter 18.\nThe Tax Man Cometh\nTrading profits are taxable and are usually taxed as income at the trader’s mar-\nginal income tax rate. Traders rarely hold positions long enough to qualify for the\nspecial (typically much lower) capital gains treatment available to long-term\ninvestors. Still, paying taxes is better than losing profits or principal.\nOne tax trap that snares traders is the wash sale rule. Normally, you can deduct\ntrading losses from trading gains before calculating your income tax burden.\nHowever, if you sell a stock for a loss and then repurchase the stock within\n30 days, you can’t deduct the trading loss. Fortunately, the loss isn’t lost for-\never.

A day trade is defined as entering and exiting a single position in the\nsame day. You can buy a stock and sell it or you can short a stock and cover the\nposition. Either way, if both transactions occur on the same day, it’s considered a\nday trade. If you day trade four or more times within a five-business-day period,\nyou’re classified as a pattern day trader unless your day trades represent fewer than\n6 percent of the total number of trades executed during the same period, which is\na huge threshold. After you’re classified as a pattern day trader, your account\nmust have at least $25,000 of equity before you’re permitted to execute additional\nday trades. Day trading margin rules are discussed in Chapter 18.\nThe Tax Man Cometh\nTrading profits are taxable and are usually taxed as income at the trader’s mar-\nginal income tax rate. Traders rarely hold positions long enough to qualify for the\nspecial (typically much lower) capital gains treatment available to long-term\ninvestors. Still, paying taxes is better than losing profits or principal.\nOne tax trap that snares traders is the wash sale rule. Normally, you can deduct\ntrading losses from trading gains before calculating your income tax burden.\nHowever, if you sell a stock for a loss and then repurchase the stock within\n30 days, you can’t deduct the trading loss. Fortunately, the loss isn’t lost for-\never. You can use it to adjust the cost basis on the trade by the amount of the\nloss, which ultimately reduces the amount of tax owed when the position is\nfinally closed. This adjustment effectively raises the cost of a stock purchase, for\ntax purposes, so you owe less tax. A similar adjustment is available when\nselling short.\nDay traders receive special tax treatment, but you must be a bona fide day trader\nto qualify.

You can try to avoid these losing\ntrades, and possibly improve your overall trading results, by filtering out trading-\nrange situations. One way to accomplish that goal is by changing the buy rule to\nread as follows: Buy at tomorrow’s open when the following conditions are true:\n» Today’s closing price is above the 50-day EMA.\n» The stock crossed above the 50-day EMA sometime during the last 5 days.\n» Today’s 50-day EMA is greater than the 50-day EMA from 5 days ago.\nThese added conditions serve as signal confirmation.

Here’s an issue: If you were to put the main Gann\n314 PART 4 Dynamic Analysis\n\n[Page 331]\nretracement numbers (12.5, 25, 50, and 75 percent) and the main Fibonacci\nretracement numbers (23.5 percent, 38 percent, and 62 percent) on the same chart\nof a trend, you’d have so many lines that the next retracement would be bound to\nhit one of them or a level near one of them.\nSome advisors using one of the wave or cycle ideas choose to display the retrace-\nments that did work while conveniently not mentioning all the others that could\nhave been shown on the same chart. In other words, they’re going to be right no\nmatter how the retracement turns out. You may see advertisements and solicita-\ntions claiming that the seller has objective methods of forecasting securities\nprices, and these methods are often based on Gann or Fibonacci “scientific” prin-\nciples. Beware. By definition, all math is science.

    "context": "When you see a downmove\nlike the one in Figure 6-3, you may want to join the crowd and be a seller.\n108 PART 2 Building Indicators from the Ground Up\n\n[Page 125]\nFIGURE 6-3:\nA series of\ndown-days.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nHope, fear, and risk management at the close\nOn an up-day, you hear that “today the bulls won” or on a down-day, “today the\nbears won,” acknowledging the emotional aspect of trading — bulls hope for a\nprofit (greed) and bears fear a loss. But emotion may have nothing to do with it.\nTraders also make buy/sell decisions to manage risk.\nJust as some traders buy on the open as a standard practice, some traders sell\non the close, chiefly to eliminate the risk of loss if something happens overnight\nto push the price down. Institutions as well as individuals use this simple\nrisk-management tactic. Should you? Yes, if you fear the market could gap over\nyour stop.\nBecause so many people exit on the close, the close is seldom the high of the day.\nAnd when the close is at the exact high of the day, that’s useful information. It\nmeans people who do hold overnight positions are buying right up to the last\nminute, offsetting the usual end-of-day sales. This is a strongly bullish signal.\nGoing up: The high\nThe high of the price bar is literally the highest point of the bar. It’s the highest\nprice at which a buyer and seller made an exchange of cash for the security. The\nbuyer thinks the price will rise some more. The seller holds the opposite view —\nthat the price will likely fall.\nThe high of the day has meaning only in the context of its relationship to other\nparts of the same bar, especially the close, and to the high the day before.\nCHAPTER 6 Reading Basic Bars: How to Pounce on Opportunities 109",

Instead you could be looking at some other secu-\nrity that does have a chance of a significant move.\n268 PART 4 Dynamic Analysis\n\n[Page 285]\nCatching the Big Kahuna:\nPoint-and-Figure Charts\nPoint-and-figure (P&F ) charts have been around for more than 100 years and are\nprobably available on all charting software. More than likely, floor traders in the\n1870s invented P&F as a pre-electronic way to record the relevant price moves\ninstead of every tiny f",
    "output": "ractional change. P&F charting strips away time and dis-\nplays only significant prices on the chart. Significant prices are those that exceed\nthe high or low of a recent trading range by a specified amount. You ignore minor\nmoves — literally. You don’t even record them on your chart. The result is filtered\nprice action. You don’t see a price move in the opposite direction of the current\ntrend until it meets your own definition of meaningful, raising confidence in the\naccuracy of a reversal signal.\nYou can also easily identify patterns on P&F charts, especially support and resis-\ntance, and therefore, breakouts of support and resistance. P&F charts look very\ndifferent from standard bar charts, but after you get used to them, you may find\ntheir directness and simplicity addictive. P&F is the easiest of all the technical\nconcepts, and as Jeremy du Plessis points out in The Definitive Guide to Point and\nFigure (Harriman House), the only computational method that is unique to finan-\ncial prices. Engineers and scientists use measures like standard deviation, but\nthey never use P&F.",

Instead, the obligations of the futures contract eventually are settled\nwith cash. In this scenario, the bread maker will probably buy his wheat at the\ncurrent price of $5 per bushel when he needs it, but because he speculated cor-\nrectly on the price, it’s only really costing him $40,000 (rather than $50,000 at\nthe current market price) to buy the wheat. Although the bread maker pays\n$50,000 for 10,000 bushels of wheat, he has saved $10,000 because of the money\nhe made on the wheat futures contract. The farmer, on the other hand, sells his\nwheat at $5 per bushel and gets $50,000 cash but actually keeps only $40,000\nbecause he has to cover his loss from the futures contract.\nYou can see from this example that futures contracts are actually financial posi-\ntions. This financial position, or the buying and selling of futures contracts, is\nwhat traders are speculating about. If futures traders believe the price of wheat is\nrising, they buy futures contracts so they can benefit from the gain made by the\nprice.

Do\nyou know who those analysts represent? Do you know whether they’re indepen-\ndent analysts, buy-side analysts, or sell-side analysts? Before deciding whether to\nfollow analysts’ recommendations, be sure that you understand who pays their\nsalary and what’s in it for them.\nBuy-side analysts: You won’t see them\nYou rarely come in contact with a buy-side analyst because they work primarily for\nlarge institutional investment firms that manage mutual funds or private accounts.\nTheir primary role is analyzing stocks bought by the firm for which they work and\nnot necessarily the ones bought by individual investors.

You expect\nthe price to move the same one unit over the same length of time going forward.\nOther versions include 2x1 (price changes by two units per one unit of time) and\nother multiples up to 16x1.\nWhen you’re using the slope of a support line or standard error channel — in\nother words, the degree of steepness — to gauge the robustness of the trend by eye,\nremember the 1x1 Gann angle. You’ll find that a flattish slope (like 25 degrees)\nmeans the trend is weak, and a too-steep slope (like 70 degrees) means it’s flaky\nand prone to correction, but the 45 degree angle is just right to predict continua-\ntion of your trend with some confidence.

It might be $20, or $200, or $10,000 — but rest\nassured, some price will force you to part with it, and right now.\nCHAPTER 2 Tapping into the Wisdom of the Crowd 33\n\n[Page 50]\nIn technical trading, think of demand for a security as rising on rising prices, not\nfalling ones. Similarly, the supply of a security dries up on rising prices, at least in\nthe short run. (Later, when the long-term security holder sees how high the price\nhas gone while he wasn’t looking, he may say “Holy Toledo!” and call his broker\nto sell, making more supply available.)\nIdentifying Crowd Behavior\nTechnical analysis is the art of identifying crowd behavior, also called the\nbandwagon effect, in order to join the crowd and take advantage of its momentum.\n(A subset of the bandwagon effect is named momentum investing, which I talk\nabout in Chapter 13). Crowd behavior is also referred to as the herd effect, a some-\nwhat insulting term considering that a herd stampedes when its leader spots a\nlion in the tall grass ahead and sends out a warning cry. In other words, it’s not\nsuch a bad thing to be a member of a herd.\nHere’s how a bandwagon works: A fresh piece of news comes out. Traders inter-\npret the news as favorable to the security, and a flood of bids allows sellers to raise\ntheir prices. You see the price going up and decide to join the crowd.

    "context": "A price exists at which you can be induced to sell the\nstock for which you paid $10. It might be $20, or $200, or $10,000 — but rest\nassured, some price will force you to part with it, and right now.\nCHAPTER 2 Tapping into the Wisdom of the Crowd 33\n\n[Page 50]\nIn technical trading, think of demand for a security as rising on rising prices, not\nfalling ones. Similarly, the supply of a security dries up on rising prices, at least in\nthe short run. (Later, when the long-term security holder sees how high the price\nhas gone while he wasn’t looking, he may say “Holy Toledo!” and call his broker\nto sell, making more supply available.)\nIdentifying Crowd Behavior\nTechnical analysis is the art of identifying crowd behavior, also called the\nbandwagon effect, in order to join the crowd and take advantage of its momentum.\n(A subset of the bandwagon effect is named momentum investing, which I talk\nabout in Chapter 13). Crowd behavior is also referred to as the herd effect, a some-\nwhat insulting term considering that a herd stampedes when its leader spots a\nlion in the tall grass ahead and sends out a warning cry. In other words, it’s not\nsuch a bad thing to be a member of a herd.\nHere’s how a bandwagon works: A fresh piece of news comes out. Traders inter-\npret the news as favorable to the security, and a flood of bids allows sellers to raise\ntheir prices. You see the price going up and decide to join the crowd. Now the price\nhas surpassed the upside resistance line and by a lot. Your crowd is like a horse\nwith the bit in his teeth. It’s a form of mania.",

As soon as dividend announcements are made, these values are\npriced into calls and puts currently available. Option calculators allow you to\nincorporate dividend payments that occur during the life of the option.\nIdentifying ETF option advantages\nBecause this book focuses on option trading, the number-one advantage of ETF\noptions over index options is the opportunity to access combination strategies.\nETF options are more flexible than index options because you can own the under-\nlying security and design covered strategies.\nETF option characteristics also make them more straightforward. You won’t be\nworrying about different exercise, expiration, or last trading days for ETF options\nbecause they’re all American style, just as with stocks. If you’ve already traded\nstock options, ETF options are a natural next step for you.\nWatch out for expenses. ETFs have expense ratios just like mutual funds. Because\nso many ETFs are passively managed, they’re generally lower than mutual funds\nfees, but compare ETFs to be sure you’re accessing one with reasonable ones.\nYou’ll find that a growing trend in ETFs is toward managed products, though,\nbecause they can levy higher fees.\nBy using ETFs in your investing, you quickly and inexpensively access a group of\nsecurities that can reduce the fluctuations (volatility) in your portfolio.",

The objective of this paper is to conduct empirical analysis of traditional RSI Vs. volume\nbased RSI on a set of most frequently traded stocks traded in National Stock Exchange. The current study tries\nto explain the effect of volume on stock price. In day trading it is believed that on any day if there is increased\nvolume trading on ask side of a stock, it means there is a greater demand for that stock as the demand side is\nhigher than the supply side. Changes in stock volume signify that there is some information related to the stock,\neither positive information or negative information which created a euphoria in the minds of traders. The\ncurrent day trading strategy can be considered as the hybrid strategy which takes into consideration both the\nvolume and RSI.\nKey Words: Financial forecasting, NIFTY, RSI, Technical analysis tool, Volume based RSI.",

But when you zoom\nin to view the price movements within those seemingly random trading-range\nperiods, you find that the trading range is made up of many mini trends. The\ncloser you look, the less random these price movements appear. That pattern is\nthe crux of technical analysis. These concepts are important for trading and are\ncovered more fully in Chapter 10.\nAt its core, technical analysis is used to identify the periods of time during which\ntrends occur. In general, technicians want to base their trades on trending mar-\nkets. The idea is to determine when trends begin and when they end. But which\ntrend? Are you the type of trader who is interested in the little mini trends that\nmake up a trading range? Or are you most interested in trading longer-lasting\ntrends?\nThe key to technical trading, therefore, is identifying a stock’s price trend within\nthe time frame during which you want to trade.

Although you may not have difficulty finding an\nETF that tracks exactly what you want, you do need to understand how that ETF\nbuilds its portfolios (check out the later section “Does Family Matter?” for more\non this topic).\nAvoiding the flaws\nETFs can be a great way to minimize risk while effectively implementing a sector\nrotation trading strategy, but they do have some faults that shouldn’t be ignored:\n» Fees: Every ETF charges fees. Always be sure you understand the fees and\ncarefully compare the options you’re considering.\n» Volatility: ETFs can be volatile, particularly as you start trading funds with\nmore specific benchmarks such as industry group ETFs that track gambling\nstocks or apparel retailers. The narrower the focus of the fund, the more\nvolatility it will bring. For example, an ETF that tracks a broad market index will\nbe less volatile than an ETF that tracks a particular sector or industry group. If\nyou pick an oil and gas ETF, it can fall just as hard as any oil or gas stock when\nthe entire industry takes a sharp downturn.\n» Liquidity: Although many ETFs offer high volume and high liquidity, the\ndramatic expansion of the ETF market in recent years has also resulted in a\nlarge number of newer, more thinly traded funds with lower liquidity. Watch\nthe trading volume for any ETF you’re considering for your portfolio. If the\ntrading volume is small, you may have a hard time finding a buyer when you\nwant to get out.",

The straight line starting\nat the middle of the bottom window is the linear regression (see Chapter 10). The\nline slopes upward means the price is in a slight uptrend, but at the same time,\nvolatility is on a downtrend. This is a good combination for you; trendedness is\ndelivering new profits at an ever-lower risk of a big one-period loss.

Where\nin the past each individual market would often act independently from other\nmarkets, in the present each separate market is a component of what has\nevolved into one single “market.” This is because the activity and interaction\nbetween the algos in one area, such as the bond market, often affect money\nflows in and out of commodity, foreign exchange, stocks, and options — often\nsimultaneously.

If, however, you already have a position and the signal fails, it’s wise\nto exit your position. Let the market sort out its psychology without leaving your\nmoney at risk.\nYou also need to consider economic and fundamental factors when deciding how\nto handle a failed signal. Acting on a contrary signal makes sense only if economic\nand fundamental conditions support the decision.\nFor example, if a bullish signal fails and becomes a bearish signal, selling a stock\nshort makes sense only if it’s fundamentally weak and the stock’s sector is in\ndecline. Conversely, if a bear trap occurs and generates a buy signal, taking a\nposition in the stock makes sense only if its earnings are strong and growing, its\nsector is performing well, and the economy is on an upswing.\nMany inexperienced traders mistakenly think that the best course of action after\nexiting a long position is to dive headfirst into a short trade. Just because your\nanalysis says the stock is likely to stop rising doesn’t mean that a short position is\nthe smartest option.

Stocks, commodities, and futures\nare all index components. (Chapter 9 covers index options in detail.) Here is\nthe important difference: Indexes aren’t securities. That means you can’t buy\nan index directly. Instead, you buy securities that track the value of the index,\nsuch as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that own the stocks in\na particular index — for example, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index.\n» Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): ETFs are mutual funds that trade like stocks\non an exchange. Most ETFs are designed to track an index or an underlying\nsector of a particular market. ETFs aren’t derivatives, but they can be consid-\nered quasi-derivatives, or almost derivatives, because they don’t always hold\nthe exact same securities of the index that they track. For example, some\nleveraged ETFs use more exotic securities known as swaps to mimic the action\nof the underlying index while adding leverage. Two of the most popular ETFs\nare the S&P 500 SPDR (SPY) and the Powershares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which\ntracks the Nasdaq 100 index. These two popular ETFs let you trade their\nunderlying indexes, directly or through options.\n» Stocks and bonds: Stock ownership gives you part of a company, whereas\nbond ownership makes you a debt holder. Each dynamic has its own set of\nrisks and rewards. A comparison of the three assets, stocks, bonds, and\noptions, yields a fairly straightforward picture. All three asset classes can lead\ninvestors to total loss of their investment.

    "context": "away your\nrights and obligations if you exit the contract before expiration.\n» Indexes: Think of indexes as collections of assets whose value is pooled\ntogether to measure the price of the group. Stocks, commodities, and futures\nare all index components. (Chapter 9 covers index options in detail.) Here is\nthe important difference: Indexes aren’t securities. That means you can’t buy\nan index directly. Instead, you buy securities that track the value of the index,\nsuch as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that own the stocks in\na particular index — for example, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index.\n» Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): ETFs are mutual funds that trade like stocks\non an exchange. Most ETFs are designed to track an index or an underlying\nsector of a particular market. ETFs aren’t derivatives, but they can be consid-\nered quasi-derivatives, or almost derivatives, because they don’t always hold\nthe exact same securities of the index that they track. For example, some\nleveraged ETFs use more exotic securities known as swaps to mimic the action\nof the underlying index while adding leverage. Two of the most popular ETFs\nare the S&P 500 SPDR (SPY) and the Powershares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which\ntracks the Nasdaq 100 index. These two popular ETFs let you trade their\nunderlying indexes, directly or through options.\n» Stocks and bonds: Stock ownership gives you part of a company, whereas\nbond ownership makes you a debt holder. Each dynamic has its own set of\nrisks and rewards. A comparison of the three assets, stocks, bonds, and\noptions, yields a fairly straightforward picture. All three asset classes can lead\ninvestors to total loss of their investment. And though stocks give you a piece\n26 PART 1 Getting Started with Options Trading",

Most important, the ratio\nof any two consecutive numbers approximates 1.618 or its inverse, 0.618. One to 1.618\nis named the “golden ratio.”\nNature offers many examples of this ratio: daisy petals, ferns, sunflowers, seashells,\nhurricanes, whirlpools, and atomic particles in a bubble chamber. And many of man’s\nworks purportedly embody the Fibonacci ratios as well: the pyramids in Egypt, the\nParthenon in Greece, and Cézanne’s choice of canvas shape, although some mathema-\nticians dispute some or all of these.",

Success on the Forex market means hav-\ning to trade in large sums, because profits are made at exchange-rate differences\nof only fractions of a cent. Banks or brokers determine the leverage they want to\noffer you, but you won’t find strict regulations like the ones that govern stock\nmargin accounts.\nAfter they’re approved for trading, customers are given a set amount or allowance\non which they can trade on margin.

    "output": "l Street uses 360 days to calculate interest.\nThus, for example, if you borrowed the money for 20 days, divide $500 by 20,\nwhich equals $25. In this case, your margin cost would be $25.\nShort stock\nWhen you short a stock, you’re doing so in the hope that the stock will drop in\nprice, so you reverse the order of the typical stock transaction. Rather than buying\nfirst and selling later, you sell first and buy the stock later.\nThere is a method to the madness, though. To sell a stock you don’t own, you need\nto borrow the shares from your broker. But depending on market conditions,\nshares may or may not be available to you for selling short. Thus, always check\nyour broker’s short sale list or contact them directly to determine whether you can\nmake the transaction based on availability of shares. Traders using brokers that\nspecialize in active trading accounts will likely find it to be less of a problem.\nOnline brokers make short selling easy.

You entered the trade on Bar #7 when NOV traded above the February 28\nintraday high of $35.00. The trade would stop out two bars later for a loss.\nYears later, NOV traded far higher — even up above $77.00 a share. There were\nmany trading opportunities for a swing trader using this stock throughout that\ntime. Practice finding good swing trades by working with historical charts and\nlook for trends similar to the ones noted earlier.\nSwing trades don’t always work out, of course. Complications and frequent losing\ntrades always are possible.\nSurfing channels\nAnother trend-following approach to swing trading uses a channeling strategy to\nidentify entry and exit points. Chapter 10 explains the channeling strategy and\nhow to construct the channel lines. After you identify a channel on the daily\ncharts, you treat channel lines as lines of support and resistance. Figure 17-3\nshows an example.\nFIGURE 17-3:\nA chart of\nConocoPhillips\n(COP), in a\ntrend channel.\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\nAfter identifying support and resistance levels for a channeling stock, you can\nmonitor its chart for reversals near the channel lines. As the stock price approaches\nthe lower or support channel line, you have an opportunity to take a position in the\ndirection of the trend. After entering a position, your stop-loss order is entered\njust below the support channel line. As the stock price approaches the upper or\nresistance channel line, it signals when to exit your position.\n284 PART 5 Risk-Taker’s Paradise",

In this instance, both ATR and HV bot-\ntomed nearly simultaneously along with SPY two weeks before the election. Both\nthen rose slightly before again turning lower and staying at low readings. Note\nhow both indicators, by staying low, correctly predicted a steady market, where\nSPY made multiple new highs. If I were trying to time this market during this\nperiod of time, I’d be looking for a change in the general trajectory of both HV and\nATR as a signal that a change in the trend was coming.\nThere is no one perfect indicator. You should make buy and sell decisions after\ncarefully analyzing and confirming with multiple indicators and trend analysis.\nHowever, price events tend to repeat over time. In these examples, which are use-\nful illustrators of what can happen in the markets in real time, a rise in ATR and\nHV signaled rising volatility, which preceded a change in the trend. Because peri-\nods of low volatility tend to eventually precede periods of high volatility, option\ntraders should consider buying options during periods of low IV and look to sell\noptions as volatility rises. This method of analysis should be confirmed by other\ntechnical indicators of trend and momentum along with the general price trend of\nthe underlying.\nCHAPTER 6 Sector Analysis: Technical and Fundamental 107",

This is so common that\nmost charting software programs have a standard command — “create parallel line”\nor “duplicate.” No one knows why support and resistance lines are so often parallel.\nHere are a few possible explanations:\n• Channel orderliness ar",
    "output": "ises from an orderly trading crowd. Market participants\nknow where the price is relatively high — at the top of the channel. They expect\nno more gains at this point. Die-hard buyers, in turn, see when the price is relatively\ncheap — down around the support line. They buy more, propelling the price\nupward.\n• Many technical analysts perceive a cyclical quality to the ebb and flow of prices\nwithin a channel. Their trading plan relies on the security alternating between\nsupport and resistance. This often works as long as you don’t project the price\nbouncing off support and resistance indefinitely. In other words, don’t get cocky.\n• Humans have an innate need to impose order and patterns. Parallel lines don’t\nalways appear, of course, but they appear often enough that observers speak of\nchannels with a certain air of authority. This kind of parallel support and resistance\nchannel is usually what the commentator has in mind. Beware — channels aren’t\ninevitable or divinely inspired.\nConsidering the benefits of channels\nWhen you use straight lines to represent a range, you get a chart that’s easy to\nread.

In\nfact, you can use the inverse of the adverse excursion, the maximum favorable\nexcursion, to select trades in the first place. See Chapter 14 on volatility.\nTrailing stops\nTrailing stops use a dynamic process that follows the price: You raise the stop as the\ntrade makes profits. A trailing stop is set on a money basis — you maintain the\nloss you can tolerate at a constant dollar amount or percentage basis.

Or the trader was trying to break a trendline or had some other hidden\nagenda.\nCommon gaps often occur when liquidity is low, meaning only a few players are\nin the market. A security that normally has low volume tends to have more gaps\nthan heavily traded securitie",
    "output": "s. A low-volume security is described as thinly traded,\nmeaning few market participants. Don’t try to interpret gaps in thinly traded\nsecurities. These gaps are usually just common gaps and mean nothing at all. At\nthe same time, a heavily traded security can also have gaps as traders flail around\ntrying to validate the new gap direction because it favors their existing position or\nfight against the new gap direction because if the price keeps going, their existing\nposition will suffer a loss. Another cause of gaps in heavily traded securities is the\nfist-fight between bulls and bears changing their interpretation of a new event.\nThis is fairly common in the foreign exchange and commodity markets.\nTo judge an opening gap, consult volume. If volume is low or normal, traders\naren’t jumping on the bandwagon, and it’s probably a common gap. If volume is\nabnormally high, traders are jumping on the bandwagon, and the gap will prob-\nably lead to a big rise or fall in the coming days.\nCHAPTER 7 Special Bars — An Early Warning System 129",

Putting money into a securities market — and\ntaking it out with a gain — is no different: You need good timing to get the best\nresults.\nTechnical traders all over the world, amateur and professional alike, earn a living\nusing technical analysis to time their trades in many different markets.

A few years\nago, an Internet search for the term “technical analysis” returned 206 million\nresponses. Now it returns 1.36 billion responses. Even after weeding out duplicates\nand mismatches, it’s still a huge amount of material. Don’t be intimidated by the\nsheer size of the available material. In this fourth edition of Technical Analysis For\nDummies, I cover the core concepts, most of which you could apply today with no\nfurther research. If you were to explore the most advanced entry in the 1.36 billion\nentries, most of it would be familiar to you from reading this book.\nTechnical ideas range from the super simple to the tremendously complex. I cover\nthe core concepts that are the building blocks of all, or nearly all, of those tremen-\ndously complex systems. It’s up to you to choose to stay with one of two simple\nideas or forge onward to the complex. There is no single best technical idea or\ncombination of ideas, for reasons I explain.\nTechnical analysis is not only a set of tools. It’s also a mindset, a way of looking\nat securities prices and how they wag and what wags them. The first principle of\nthe technical mindset is to throw conventional wisdom out the window and trade\nwhat you see on the chart. Technical analysis is an evidence-based method of\nIntroduction 1",

Calculating premiums, you obtain this:\n» 154.00 CallPut 3 × $5.90 × 100 = $1,770\n» 150.00 CallPut 4 × $4.30 × 100 = $1,720\nBecause the position is an investment and has protection beyond",

Based on your thor-\nough analysis, you bought an excellent protection package for your SPY position.\nBy choosing December as your decision point, you also gave yourself enough time\nto decide your next step.\nTilting Your Portfolio with Sector ETFs\nA portfolio tilt is an investing approach that attempts to beat a market benchmark\nby allocating a portion of the funds to an asset that is highly correlated with that\nbenchmark and adding smaller allocations in sectors that are outperforming the\nbenchmark. Alternatively, underperforming sectors can be underweighted.\nBoth sector index options and ETF options can be used to implement the tilt por-\ntion of the portfolio. Using the protected SPY position created in the last section as\na base portfolio, sector ETFs are added to tilt the portfolio. Assume there is $5,000\navailable for ETF sector allocations.\nA very simple way to tilt your portfolio is by using sector ETFs, which I explain in\nthe following section. This strategy is especially useful when going long if there is\na particular sector that is currently outperforming the market. You can also add\nunderperforming sectors when creating short positions.\n266 PART 3 What Every Trader Needs to Know about Options",

Note: The option expired within 16 days\nof the trade date, which was perfect. The fact that it netted a $1 premium was\nexcellent and a direct result of the high IV.\nI wasn’t completely sure of which way things would go, though, so I bought ASO\non April 6 $20 put option for $0.35 on March 29 as well and set up a collar, just in\ncase the stock cratered on a bad earnings report.\nWhen the report came ou",
    "output": "t, the shares moved decidedly higher. Because I didn’t\nwant to be assigned on the call, I bought to close the call option for $0.60 and\nsimultaneously sold 100 shares of ASO for $27. The put option became worthless\nbecause the stock rallied, so the net gain for this trade: $200 (stock gain) – $40\n(option buy back) – $35 by letting the put option expire worthless was $125.\nSelling a call against a long stock position doesn’t protect it — it moderately\nreduces risk by reducing your net costs. Also, the further IV is from HV, the higher\nthe odds of the underlying moving and these conditions favor option sellers.\nFigure 16-1 shows the period of consolidation (ellipse) and the breakout (arrow)\nafter the earnings report. The stock rallied for a few days and entered another\nconsolidation period with similar technical characteristics (ADI, OBV, shrinking\nBollinger Bands), but with one big difference: IV fell back to where it was close to\nHV. As a result, I didn’t sell more options on ASO during that period. Because\nI kept some shares of the stock, I was able to participate in the next rally.\nCHAPTER 16 Trading Profitably When Markets Move Sideways 329",

The starting\npoint is a top or bottom on the chart extended out by hand to the next low or high,\nand the fan lines represent alternative support and resistance lines. It’s likely that\nlater techniques using geometrics similar to the Gann fan (Andrews pitchfork and\nspeed resistance lines, not covered in this book) were based on this 1935 work\nby Gann.\nCelebrating Gann’s 50 percent\nretracement rule\nOne of Gann’s more lasting contributions to technical analysis is the 50 percent\nretracement rule. Gann discovered that retracements in the securities he was\ntrading at the time tended to occur at one-half of the original move from the low\nto the high. To illustrate, say the price moved from $10 to $30. At $30, the crowd\ndecided that the security was overbought and started to sell. The ensuing price\ndecline, the retracement, stops near 50 percent of the original $10 to $30 move,\nnamely $20.

    "context": "ock, a useful scenario for a covered call strategy occurs when you own a stock\nthat is currently moving sideways in price. By selling the call you’re essentially\ngiving yourself an advance for any further gains in the stock as limited by the\nstrike price. The best outcome would be for the stock to rise above the strike price.\nAt that point, you have two choices:\n» Buy back the option. This choice makes sense if the gain in the stock far\noutpaces what you’d have to pay to buy back the option.\n» Wait. You want to see if you’re assigned and have to surrender the stock.\nIf you have the stock called away, it’s no big deal because you can simply buy the\nstock again after the expiration date and sell another covered call against it. For\nthat reason, the short call strike price should be above the long stock purchase price.\nAlways keep in mind that your risk with such a position is still pretty high — just\nbecause you have a bullish outlook for the stock doesn’t mean it will necessarily\ngo up in the short term (or the long term, for that matter).\nTime is a factor with option positions. Having a long option is best when time\ndecay is at a minimum. Meanwhile, having short option positions is best when\ntime decay is increasing (less than 45 days to expiration).\nCHAPTER 12 Combination Strategies: Spreads and Other Wild Things 231",

If you take an indicator rule that entails losses greater than\n2 percent of capital, but have a series of losing trades early in your trading career,\nyou could lose a lot of money before you figure out how to adapt your indicators.\nTime stops\nTime stops acknowledge that money tied up in a trade that’s going nowhere can be put\nto better use in a different trade (or a savings account). Say you’re holding a position\nthat starts going sideways. It’s reasonable to exit the trade and find a different secu-\nrity that is moving. Remember, the purpose of trading is to make money.\nClock and calendar stops\nClock and calendar stops pertain to a price event happening (or not happening)\nconsidering the time of day, week, month, or year. Clock-based rules abound.\nSome technical traders advise against trading during the first hour in the\nU.S. stock market, because buy- or sell-on-open orders are being executed then\n(see Chapter 6). Others say that more gain can be had from the first hour than any\nother hour of the trading day if you can figure out which way the crowd is trading.\nAs I describe in Chapter 16, one setup technique is to buy or sell the direction of\nan opening gap — and be done in an hour.\nCHAPTER 5 Managing the Trade 93",

The\nfailure of the second shoulder to surpass the head is the end of the rally. Buying\ndemand diminishes and selling pressure takes hold, forcing prices down, com-\npleting the pattern. Note that if you get three tops at about the same level, it’s not\na head-and-shoulders but a triple top. The bullish version occurs to the bottom of\nthe chart and is called an inverse head-and-shoulders. It’s bullish because after the\nthree bottoms, the price is expected to move to the upside.\nAs with double tops and bottoms, however, some traders refuse to accept the\npattern, and they cause a pullback to the confirmation line on many occasions.\nPullbacks are short-lived, only a week or two, before the security resumes its\ndecline. This is your last chance to jump off before the price hits the wall. Don’t\n168 PART 3 Finding Patterns",

Low interest rates are associated\nwith economic troughs, and high rates with economic peaks. In a nutshell, the Fed\nlowers rates to stimulate economic activity and raises rates to slow it. But the time\nlag between the Fed’s activity and any reaction by the economy is often a long one,\nmaking the Fed’s monetary policy an imprecise indicator. Nevertheless, you can\nuse interest rates to get a rough idea about the current economic landscape.\nInterest-rate reductions that the Fed approves are generally good news for the\nstock market. And when the Fed tightens its monetary policy by raising interest\nrates, stocks normally react poorly. Either way, stock markets may not react\nimmediately, and unfortunately, many months can pass before either the stock\nmarket or the economy responds in either direction to the Fed’s action. Although\nthe old stock market saying “three steps and a stumble” doesn’t always hold true,\nmarkets do often head lower after the Fed raises rates for the third time.\nIn short, falling interest rates typically lead to a rising economy and to a market\nthat’s changing from a bear market to a bull market — in other words, a bullish\ntransition. Ultimately, a bullish transition leads to a new bull market.\n\n### Question:\nWhat information is provided about economy?\n\n### Response:\nongoing, up-to-date knowledge of the cycles through which the economy is passing helps you identify current phases of the markets, which, in turn, can help you make better trading decisions. 210 PART 4 Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks  [Page 229] Knowing when the Fed is your friend Current interest rates and interest-rate trends help determine the current posi- tion of the economy within the business cycle.

Low interest rates are associated\nwith economic troughs, and high rates with economic peaks. In a nutshell, the Fed\nlowers rates to stimulate economic activity and raises rates to slow it. But the time\nlag between the Fed’s activity and any reaction by the economy is often a long one,\nmaking the Fed’s monetary policy an imprecise indicator. Nevertheless, you can\nuse interest rates to get a rough idea about the current economic landscape.\nInterest-rate reductions that the Fed approves are generally good news for the\nstock market. And when the Fed tightens its monetary policy by raising interest\nrates, stocks normally react poorly. Either way, stock markets may not react\nimmediately, and unfortunately, many months can pass before either the stock\nmarket or the economy responds in either direction to the Fed’s action. Although\nthe old stock market saying “three steps and a stumble” doesn’t always hold true,\nmarkets do often head lower after the Fed raises rates for the third time.\nIn short, falling interest rates typically lead to a rising economy and to a market\nthat’s changing from a bear market to a bull market — in other words, a bullish\ntransition. Ultimately, a bullish transition leads to a new bull market.",
