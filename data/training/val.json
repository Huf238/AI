Similarly, the supply of a security dries up on rising prices, at least in\nthe short run. (Later, when the long-term security holder sees how high the price\nhas g",
    "output": "one while he wasn’t looking, he may say “Holy Toledo!” and call his broker\nto sell, making more supply available.)\nIdentifying Crowd Behavior\nTechnical analysis is the art of identifying crowd behavior, also called the\nbandwagon effect, in order to join the crowd and take advantage of its momentum.\n(A subset of the bandwagon effect is named momentum investing, which I talk\nabout in Chapter 13). Crowd behavior is also referred to as the herd effect, a some-\nwhat insulting term considering that a herd stampedes when its leader spots a\nlion in the tall grass ahead and sends out a warning cry. In other words, it’s not\nsuch a bad thing to be a member of a herd.\nHere’s how a bandwagon works: A fresh piece of news comes out. Traders inter-\npret the news as favorable to the security, and a flood of bids allows sellers to raise\ntheir prices. You see the price going up and decide to join the crowd. Now the price\nhas surpassed the upside resistance line and by a lot. Your crowd is like a horse\nwith the bit in his teeth. It’s a form of mania.",

If you like only one or two setups,\nyou have to monitor a large universe of securities.\n» If you focus on setups to the exclusion of all the other technical concepts,\nyou’re at a loss for what to do when setups don’t appear.\n» To find your favorite setups, you have to scan a list of securities, and the best\nsetups may appear in securities that you wouldn’t touch with a bargepole on a\nfundamental or value basis.\n» Setups require intense concentration and often the ability to trade actively\nduring market hours. If you have a day job, this task can be impossible.\nGuerrilla trading\nGuerrilla trading is setup trading on adrenaline.",

You’ll buy more ice cream if the price falls from $5 to 50 cents, but no price\nwill induce you to buy gallons and gallons of the stuff every week. People buy more\nwhen price falls, but with a limit. The same is true about price increases. If your\nbarber raises",
    "output": "his price from $20 to $120, you’ll schedule fewer appointments. At\nsome price, like $250, if everyone has that price, you’ll demand no services at all.\nSupply is relatively fixed at any one point in time, but manufacturers and service\nproviders respond vigorously to price. Rising prices induce suppliers to make\nmore of the product or offer more of the service. Retired barbers come out of the\nwoodwork when the price of a cut goes to $250. New supply, whether of ice cream\nor barbers, forces the price back down, at least a little. The opposite is true, too.\nFalling prices send manufacturers and service providers out of business or into\ndifferent businesses that don’t have falling demand.\nThe constant shifting of prices as supply and demand adjust to one another is\nreferred to as price discovery — the price point where supply and demand meet. It’s\na constantly changing number. Price discovery is dynamic, which means it’s con-\nstantly adjusting to new conditions.\nSecurities prices behave in response to supply and demand like any other\ngood.",

By then, you figure that the move is well in\nplace. But remember, you have to have one stop-loss order on the first\ncontract and a different one on the second trade.\nApplying stops to adjusted positions\nIf you’re using an indicator stop and it signals that the price rise is over, doesn’t\nthat mean you want to exit all positions at the same level as soon as possible? The\nanswer from statisticians is maybe. It depends on whether you’re thinking in\nchart terms or money-management terms. If you’re using a breakout concept to\nset your stop, for example, the price crossing a support line (as in Chapter 10) is a\nsell signal that would apply equally to all positions.\nIf you’re using a 2 percent or other rule (like the chandelier exit I mention in this\nchapter) that is calculated specifically with reference to your starting point, you\nexit each trade according to the rule. This method has benefits and drawbacks.\nThe benefit is that you’re still in the trade if the stop was triggered for one trade\nbut the price retracement is only a minor, temporary one. You still have other\npositions left and if the price makes a big jump your way, you’re correctly posi-\ntioned to take advantage of it.\n\n### Question:\nCan you explain enough based on the document?\n\n### Response:\nIf you’re trading on a 50 percent margin, you add to the CHAPTER 5 Managing the Trade 95  [Page 112] position when the existing position has racked up enough paper gain to fund the new position.

They accept the standard parameters and put their effort into\nsomething else, like bar or pattern reading that is subjective and the very devil to\ntrack accurately and evaluate for effectiveness.\nBut if you are going to backtest indicators to refine parameters, do it right. Use a\nlarge amount of price history when testing an indicator — and don’t make the\nindicator fit history so perfectly that the minute you add fresh data, the indicator\nbecomes worthless (curve-fitting). Observing price behavior and estimating the\nrange of sensible and reasonable parameters is better than finding the perfect\nnumber.

This is a warning of an overbought or oversold condition and thus\na potential retracement or reversal.\nConvergence and divergence\nConvergence refers to two indicator lines coming closer to one another, such as\nwhen a support line and a resistance line converge to form a triangle (see\nChapter 9) or two moving averages get closer together (see Chapter 13), indicating\nless difference between their numerical values. Convergence generally means that\nthe price action is starting to go sideways or has a narrower high-low range, or\nboth. A sideways move, in turn, generally leads to a breakout, although it can take\na painfully long time. Convergence doesn’t have an embedded trading rule and is\nmore often used as a warning that a change in direction or the strength of a trend\nis changing.\nDivergence refers to two indicator lines moving farther apart, such as when the\nspread between two moving averages widens.

This is a warning of an overbought or oversold condition and thus\na potential retracement or reversal.\nConvergence and divergence\nConvergence refers to two indicator lines coming closer to one another, such as\nwhen a support line and a resistance line converge to form a triangle (see\nChapter 9) or two moving averages get closer together (see Chapter 13), indicating\nless difference between their numerical values. Convergence generally means that\nthe price action is starting to go sideways or has a narrower high-low range, or\nboth. A sideways move, in turn, generally leads to a breakout, although it can take\na painfully long time. Convergence doesn’t have an embedded trading rule and is\nmore often used as a warning that a change in direction or the strength of a trend\nis changing.\nDivergence refers to two indicator lines moving farther apart, such as when the\nspread between two moving averages widens.

You’ll have to make more trades to restore the total\ncapital stake to $10,000.\nYou should never put your entire capital stake on the first trade. Experts differ on\nhow much you should put into the first trade, but a general rule is 10 to 20 percent.\nCalculating expectancy and figuring out how much money you can expect to make\n(and lose) and how much of your capital stake to put into trades is a tedious,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming project. You may think you can skip this step.\nTo calculate expectancy and apply it to find out your money gain and number of\ntrades needed is more about money or risk management than about technical\nanalysis itself. Note how many times in this book I say “No indicator works all the\ntime.” You should want to know how many times it fails and how much those\nfailures will cost you. I stress again and again that technical analysis is about more\nthan the indicators; it’s also about the technical mindset that acknowledges no\nindicator works all the time, so be prepared. All that fiddly arithmetic may be tire-\nsome to you. But when that tiresome arithmetic starts reducing losses and starts\nhelping you make some real money, you’ll dislike it less and less over time until it\nbecomes second nature.\nThe cost of books on risk management is far higher than the cost of books on\nindicators or crowd psychology. That price difference shows which topic is more\nimportant.\n100 PART 1 Getting Started with Technical Analysis",

The dead-cat bounce is\none of the patterns that disproves that idea — by the end of six months after the\ngap, only a little more than half of price moves close the gap, according to\nBulkowski’s studies.\nThe dead-cat bounce is one of the most successful patterns of all, delivering a\nsuccess rate nearing 90 percent and steady over three decades.\n164 PART 3 Finding Patterns",

You don’t know\nwhether you can draw the support line until afterward, but you can see the ATR\nindicator failing to match that spiky high and continue to fall. The price is rising,\nbut the indicator is falling. And as usual, a divergence between indicator and price\nis a warning sign. Sure enough, right after the highest high, you get a series of\nlower highs and can draw a resistance line (see Chapter 10). Pretty soon the price\nbreaks under support.\n260 PART 4 Dynamic Analysis",

The long-running, steep trend may indeed be due for a reversal.\nBut the absence of evidence makes the trading decision to bet on a reversal an\nintuitive one, rather than a rational one.\nThe second, slow mode of thinking is supposedly the rational, take-your-time\nmode of decision-making. But it, too, often violates the assumption of maximiza-\ntion of self-interest. For example, experiment after experiment shows that avoid-\ning loss is a bigger preference than making a gain.",

Here’s a quick pattern primer:\n» Most patterns employ straight lines (such as triangles), although a few use\nsemicircles (such as head-and-shoulders).\n» Pattern lines generally follow either the highs or the lows.\n» Pattern types are organized according to whether they forecast a continuation\nor a reversal of the current price move, although you can apply many patterns\n(like triangles) either way.\nThe lingo of pattern analysis — double bottom and dead-cat bounce, for\nexample — can be amusing. You also see cup-and-handle, belt-hold, scoop,\nfry-pan, cradle, and jay-hook. Some of the names do seem a little silly, but they\ndescribe the price action efficiently. Nowadays you can have an analyst walk you\nthrough specific patterns on websites like www.candlestickforum.com and You-\nTube, which is especially useful for patterns. For a comprehensive review, go to\nwww.ThePatternSite.com. And keep going back. The author, Tom Bulkowski,\nwrote the definitive book on patterns and often updates material on the site.",

Even after weeding out duplicates\nand mismatches, it’s still a huge amount of material. Don’t be intimidated by the\nsheer size of the available material. In this fourth edition of Technical Analysis For\nDummies, I cover the core concepts, most of which you could apply today with no\nfurther research. If you were to explore the most advanced entry in the 1.36 billion\nentries, most of it would be familiar to you from reading this book.\nTechnical ideas range from the super simple to the tremendously complex. I cover\nthe core concepts that are the building blocks of all, or nearly all, of those tremen-\ndously complex systems. It’s up to you to choose to stay with one of two simple\nideas or forge onward to the complex. There is no single best technical idea or\ncombination of ideas, for reasons I explain.\nTechnical analysis is not only a set of tools. It’s also a mindset, a way of looking\nat securities prices and how they wag and what wags them.

Expressing chart events in\nmathematical terms allows you to backtest the event over historical data to\ndiscover how well it predicts the next price action.\nYou may prefer to jump straight to math-based indicators because they’re faster,\ncleaner, and scientific. But math-based indicators do the same job as judgment\nindicators — they display price data in a specific format to assist you in making a\ntrading decision. Just because they’re based on math doesn’t mean that they\naren’t subjective. You determine the specifications of math-based indicators in\nthe first place (such as how many days are in a moving average). Visual recogni-\ntion and math-based techniques are equally valid and useful. Some traders use\nonly visual-recognition techniques, some use only math-based indicators, and\nsome use both. Remember, the use of math doesn’t confer a crown of authenticity\non any technique.

Expressing chart events in\nmathematical terms allows you to backtest the event over historical data to\ndiscover how well it predicts the next price action.\nYou may prefer to jump straight to math-based indicators because they’re faster,\ncleaner, and scientific. But math-based indicators do the same job as judgment\nindicators — they display price data in a specific format to assist you in making a\ntrading decision. Just because they’re based on math doesn’t mean that they\naren’t subjective. You determine the specifications of math-based indicators in\nthe first place (such as how many days are in a moving average). Visual recogni-\ntion and math-based techniques are equally valid and useful. Some traders use\nonly visual-recognition techniques, some use only math-based indicators, and\nsome use both. Remember, the use of math doesn’t confer a crown of authenticity\non any technique.

A series of closes over a small number of days is an indicator in its own\nright. The close remains the most important price bar component despite after-\nthe-bell trading.

Every site has\na little icon, usually on the upper right, where you can convert the line to standard\nbars or candlesticks.\nThe close is the most important component because it summarizes trader senti-\nment.

The bad news may pertain to a political event,\na change in interest rates, a bankruptcy in the same industry, or a dozen other\nfactors.\nSummarizing sentiment: The closing price\nThe closing price is literally the last price at which a buyer bought and a seller sold\nbefore the closing bell. The close is the most important part of the price bar. If you\nwere to draw a chart by using only one of the bar components, you’d pick the\nclose. A series of closes over a small number of days is an indicator in its own\nright. The close remains the most important price bar component despite after-\nthe-bell trading. When you see a line chart at websites (including Yahoo! Finance\nor the Wall Street Journal), the line is comprised of a series of closes. Every site has\na little icon, usually on the upper right, where you can convert the line to standard\nbars or candlesticks.\nThe close is the most important component because it summarizes trader senti-\nment. Traders have watched this price all day, and by the end of the day they have\na sense of how popular it was near the lows (lots of buying going on) or how\nunpopular near the highs (lots of selling going on). They’re also looking at volume\nto confirm these impressions.",

It will be broken up when either the bullish camp or the\nbearish camp takes the initiative and causes a new high or new low, with\naccompanying higher volume.\nLooking for clues from other indicators\nWhile the breakout is a powerful technical indicator, you still want as much con-\nfirmation as you can get. Momentum and relative strength are useful to confirm\nor deny that a breakout is real (refer to Chapter 13). A loss of momentum and/or\nrelative strength in an uptrend almost always precedes a downside channel\nbreakout.\nSize matters — and so does duration\nYou can use a filter to estimate whether a breakout is meaningful or can be ignored.\nA filter is a formula or a procedure used to modify an indicator. In this instance,\nthe indicator is the break of the channel line. A filter can modify the amount or\nduration of the breakout. Here’s how you do it:\n» You add some percentage of the total range to the channel line. You stipulate\nthat to constitute a real break of the channel line, the new high or low must\nsurpass this extra amount.\nIf the channel is $5 wide, you can specify that a price high or low has to violate\nthe line by more than 5 percent (or 25 cents).",

When the price starts a new uptrend, the price breaking the upper band\nconfirms that you have identified the trend correctly.\nA downside breakout has to pass a bigger test in an uptrend. Accordingly, you widen\nthe lower band by adding a percentage of the ATR to it.",
    "output": "On the chart in Figure 14-6,\nthe lower band is 50 percent wider than the upper band (it is 150 percent of the\nATR). The last bar on the chart breaks the band, just after the support line is bro-\nken. This is no mere retracement! You have a double breakout of the trend (sup-\nport) plus a volatility breakout (ATR band).\nAs with Bollinger Bands, a breakout above the upper band signals continuation,\nbut because breakouts are a sign of abnormally high volatility, you can usually\ncount on a pullback to the median. A longer-term position trader would buy at the\nleft-hand low and hold the break of the support line. A swing trader, on the other\nhand, would sell at breakout “1” and go short the security to the touch of the sup-\nport line at point “2.” Now he becomes a buyer again to point “3,” where high\nvolatility again triggers a short position that he holds to the break of the support\nline or final ATR band breakout.\nFew traders would use the ATR breakout alone as the sole deciding factor. On\nFigure 14-6, I put only a support line, but in practice, you would be looking at other\nindicators. I didn’t do the profit-and-loss arithmetic in this case, but it’s pretty\nclear that a swing trader using volatility would have made a series of gains that col-\nlectively added up to a higher profit than the trend-following buy-and-hold trader.\n264 PART 4 Dynamic Analysis",

The ratio is then multi-\nplied by 100 to make it an oscillator that ranges between 0 and 100, again with a\nnormal spread between 30 and 70 percent or from 20 to 80 percent. Five days is\nthe standard parameter used for the indicator, although you can use software to\nfind a number of days that better fits your particular security.\nThe %K indicator shows you how much energy the price move has relative to the\nrange.",

Therefore, to fade the trend is a purely\nopportunistic action based on an understanding of crowd psychology. Fading the\ntrend also illustrates that the frame of reference of technical trading isn’t the security\nand its fundamentals, but crowd behavior.
