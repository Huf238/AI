In fact, a lot has changed since I first wrote its\npredecessor Futures and Options For Dummies in 2006. Indeed, the most radical of\nall changes in the financial markets is the role of artificial intelligence (AI), other-\nwise known as trading algorithms, also known as algos or bots. Algos are program or\ncomputer traders, and they’re now responsible for more than 80 percent of the\ntrading volume on any given day. Even more spectacular is the fact that options\ntrading volume now dwarfs individual stock trading volume, which means, that as\nI explain throughout this book, the proverbial tail now wags the dog.\nOf course, most investors, especially those who are in the early stages of their\ncareer, are in a hurry and their number one goal is profits. And why not? Who\nwants to lose money? Still, options trading is very different from stock trading.\nUnlike other investments books, this one is geared to managing risk first, with the\nknowledge that profits will follow.",

Still, options trading is very different from stock trading.\nUnlike other investments books, this one is geared to managing risk first, with the\nknowledge that profits will follow. With that in mind, the approaches I describe\nhere focus on reducing potential losses from traditional stock positions and\nbuilding an option strategy repertoire that’s designed to increase your chances of\nmaking sound trades whether the markets are moving up, down, or sideways.\nBecause I’m an active stock trader and because all the markets are now intimately\ninterrelated via money flows and the actions of trading algos everywhere, I aim to\nconnect the key dots between stocks and options for you so not only you can trade\noptions profitably, but you also actually know why any market is acting in a\nparticular way.\nAn option contract is a unique security that comes with contract rights and\nobligations. When used correctly, an option contract strikes a balance between the\nrisk of loss, the amount of money you put at risk, and reward, providing you with\nleverage, the ability to amplify the amount of profit via the use of margin, while\nstill allowing you to reduce overall trade risk. Of course, there’s another side to\nthat leverage, increased risk. That’s because margin, or the practice of trading\nwith borrowed money, works both ways.

This publication,\nwritten by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), must be distributed by brokers\nto their clients prior to allowing them to trade options. It describes option contract\nspecifications, mechanics, and the risks associated with the security. Together,\nthat publication and the one you’re reading right now help you to understand your\nrisks and use options effectively.\nAbout This Book\nThis book now its fourth edition is great for you. Not only has it stood the test of\ntime, but I’ve been able to address many of the quirks and other technical issues\nthat arose with the book’s earlier editions. Of course, nothing is perfect, but as\nyou find out when you start trading options, the more you do anything, the better\nit gets. And so it is with this book.\nRegardless of the reviews that you may read, comments from friends, or clever\nmarketing on the Internet, options trading isn’t a simple task. Don’t get discour-\naged.

But this one primarily focuses on approaches aimed at manag-\ning risk and in giving you the information you need to trade successfully against\nclever day traders and algos. And if you’re an experienced trader looking for\nsomething specific, feel free to jump around to areas that interest you most.\nOtherwise, if you’re a beginner, I recommend you start at the front and work your\nway carefully through each chapter before you risk any money. If, as you read\nthrough the book, you find a strategy that’s particularly appealing, feels natural\nto you, and makes you money as you deploy it, feel free to spend as much time as\nyou need on getting it under your belt.\nNo matter your trading experience, you certainly can read this book cover to cover\nor use it as a reference guide, because each strategy provided identifies risks and\nrewards associated with the position as well as ways to implement those strate-\ngies. This book also identifies alternative strategies to consider for risk manage-\nment, when applicable. There are a million ways to successfully trade the markets,\nbut certain challenges are universal to all of them, especially when you’re trading\nagainst algos and other entities in the market — day traders and market makers.\nTo make life as easy as possible for you, I give you tools and techniques to address\nthese challenges throughout.\n2 Options Trading For Dummies",

If you’re a\nbeginner, you may find a lot of the material in this book confusing. And that’s not\nyour fault, or mine. That’s just the way it is because although options trading\noriginated in ancient Greece, in its modern form, it has been modified by guys\nwith PhDs and further altered via trading algos. Thus, my goal is to make it as\nsimple as I can for you. But there is only so much I can do with such a complex\ntopic, so please be patient.\nThat means reading this material may initially be challenging. But, let me share\none thing: I’m a dummy too, and that’s precisely why Dummies books are so\nimportant because they make challenging topics like options trading (and algebra\nand anatomy and the LSAT) easier to understand.

Of course, the best reason to add options to your\ntrading or investing strategies is the fact they allow you to both manage your risk\nand grow your assets while using less money per trade rather than by owning\nindividual stocks.\nNo matter what your options strategy or your time frame are at any time —\nwhether you hold positions for short or long periods — your goal is essentially the\nsame.

Throughout this book I give you the information to rewire your brain and\nthink in a slightly different way about the markets and how your trading fits into\nwhat’s happening at any time during the trading day. More important, the rewir-\ning also includes how the market is affecting your trading and how you can turn\nthis knowledge into your advantage. And no, rewiring your brain doesn’t hurt. But\nit does help you to see the markets in a different and more profitable way.\nChapter 7 is an excellent rewiring chapter.\nKeep these points in mind about the rewiring process:\n» Options trading, as all types of trading, is an adversarial process — a\nfight if you will. In other words, whomever or whatever is on the other side\nof your trade has one goal in mind: to take your money. Of course, whether\nyou realize it or not, you have the same goal.

In effect they’re computer\nprograms, also referred to as artificial intelligence (AI) or bots.\nIn this book I refer to them as algos.

In fact, the market makers, the entities that match buy and sell\norders, are all computerized. As a result, events in the markets now happen\nliterally at the speed of light due to the involvement of algos.\nI examine this dynamic throughout the book. I show you how to spot them\nand how you can prepare to trade against them with frequent success. For\nnow, my goal is to plant this thought in your mind and thus start the rewiring.\nChapter 5 discusses the technical aspects of trading with the algos.\nAlgos day traders, and whomever else is trading at any time, don’t have your best\ninterest in mind.

Let me be clear: Investing is all about using the power of time and\nthe benefits of compounding to build wealth over long periods. The traditional\nbuy-and-hold strategy for stocks is a perfect example, as is the owning of rental\nproperties for long periods to generate income. This long-term-oriented, patient\nmind-set often, but not always, works well for stocks and mutual funds, but it\ndoesn’t work for options because of the way the algos move the markets and\nbecause of the time limit in the life of an option. One partial exception, that of\ntrading long-term options, is a viable trading tactic that I address in this book\n(see Chapter 11).\nThe bottom line is that you may trade any option for a few minutes, a few days, or\na few weeks, but no matter how long you’re in an options position, even if it’s part\nof your long-term investment plan, it’s a trade. At the same time, don’t confuse\noptions trading with some random, haphazard activity. Options trading is a cau-\ntious and very precise exercise, which it’s why it’s an exercise in risk planning.\nChapter 8 shows you how to design a “killer” trading plan.\nPreparing to Trade: Take a Pre-Trading\nFlight Check\nYou wouldn’t fly a plane before doing a pre-flight check, so before you start any\nkind of trading or investing program, it’s a good idea to know three things:\n» Your risk profile\n» Your financial situation\n» Your time commitment possibilities\nAs you begin to trade options, be patient and prepare to spend as much time as you\nneed learning the craft, or you’ll lose money, often in a hurry, because the algos\naren’t your friend.\nEven if you’re experienced in other forms of investing, or have experience with\noptions, you should still stop and consider the following:\n» Check your financial balance sheet. Before you start trading any financial\ninstrument, go over your living expenses and review your credit card, loans,\nmortgages, and life and health insurances. Put together a financial net worth\nstatement. Make sure it’s healthy before you take extraordinary risks.\nCHAPTER 1 Options Trading and You, the Individual Investor 11",

This understanding may require a more thorough level of analysis and\ndetail beyond your current routine. For example, because volatility is a key com-\nponent of option prices, you’ll have to look at the underlying’s historical volatility\nmore carefully as part of your analysis in order to pick the best possible option for\nyour particular strategy.\nThis book helps you by focusing on techniques that compare options to their\nunderlying security or other securities.

All listed options contracts are governed by the same rules. When you cre-\nate a new position, one of two things is triggered:\n» By buying an option, you’re buying a specific set of rights.\n» By selling an option, you’re acquiring a specific set of obligations.\nThese rights and obligations are standard and are guaranteed by the Option Clear-\ning Corporation (OCC), so you never have to worry about who’s on the other end\nof the agreement — assume it’s an algo.

The goal of a hedge is to reduce the potential loss when the market turns\nagainst you. That’s because a properly designed hedge is one in which the value of\nthe option goes in the opposite direction of the underlying, thus keeping the total\nvalue of the combined position as high as possible when the underlying falls in\nvalue.

Because options cost less than stocks,\nyou can participate in a market for less than if you owned the actual shares. For\nexample, a $500 investment in an option strategy may give you as much profit\npotential as a $5,000 investment in an individual stock. This is an excellent way\nto reduce risk, because you’re spending less capital but potentially getting a sim-\nilar rate of return to what you might receive if you owned the actual underlying\nstock, depending on your position size.

Although some option contracts are over the counter, meaning they’re\nbetween two parties without going through an exchange, this chapter focuses on\nstandardized contracts known as listed options that trade on exchanges. Moreover,\nunlike stocks, which are about ownership of shares, option contracts give the\nowner rights and the seller obligations.\nDefining the basics\nHere are the key definitions and details:\n» Call option: A call option gives the owner (seller) the right (obligation) to buy\n(sell) a specific number of shares of the underlying stock at a specific price by\na predetermined date. A call option gives you the opportunity to profit from\nprice gains in the underlying stock at a fraction of the cost of owning the stock.\n» Put option: Put options give the owner (seller) the right (obligation) to sell\n(buy) a specific number of shares of the underlying stock at a specific price by\na specific date. If you own put options on a stock that you own and the price\nof the stock is falling, the put option is gaining in value, thus offsetting the\nlosses on the stock and giving you an opportunity to make decisions about\nyour stock ownership without panicking.\n» Rights of the owner of an options contract: A call option gives the owner\nthe right to buy a specific number of shares of stock at a predetermined price.",

Sellers of put options have the obligation to buy a specific amount of\nstock at a predetermined price.\nIn order to maximize your use of options, for both risk management and trading\nprofits, make sure you understand the concepts in this chapter. Focus on the option,\nconsider how you might use it, and gauge the risk and reward associated with the\noption and the strategy. If you keep these factors in mind as you study each section,\nthe concepts will be much easier to use as you move on to real-time trading.\nGrasping what investors’ objectives\nare with stock options\nTrades have two sides: Your side and the other side (the counter party).

Their actions have as much or more effect on the mar-\nkets and on your chances of success as your own side of the trade. Chapter 5\nexplains this topic in greater detail.\nUse stock options for the following objectives:\n» To benefit from upside moves for less money\n» To profit from downside moves in stocks without the risk of short selling\n» To protect an individual stock position or an entire portfolio during periods of\nfalling prices and market downturns\nConsidering the risks\nAlways be aware of the risks of trading options. Here are two key concepts:\n» Option contracts have a limited life. Each contract has an expiration date.\nThat means if the price move you anticipate doesn’t happen by the expiration\ndate, you’ll lose your entire initial investment. You can figure out how these\nthings happen by paper trading before you do it in real time. Paper trading\nlets you try different options and strategies for any underlying stock that\noffers options, accomplishing two things:\n• You can see what happens in real time.\n• Seeing what happens, in turn, lets you figure out how to pick the best\noption, design the best strategy, and manage the position.\nYou can read more about paper trading in Chapter 7.\n» The wrong strategy can lead to losing trades. This can be in the form of\nmajor losses in any individual position — but not necessarily to your entire\nportfolio if you manage your position size (trade small number of contracts —\none to two contracts versus five or six or more contracts at any time).",

This is the same\nthing that would happen if you sold stocks short, which would defeat the\npurpose of trading options.

Stock options derive their value from the underlying stock. In\norder to better understand option valuations, it makes sense to know more about\nother derivatives and exchange-traded mutual funds (ETFs):\n» Commodities and futures contracts: Like options, commodity and futures\ncontracts are agreements between two parties. The seller of an option is\nobligated to buy or sell stock if the option buyer exercises the option. That’s\nbecause commodities and futures contacts set the price for a predetermined\nquantity of a physical item to be delivered to a particular location on a\npredetermined date. Stock options have no delivery date in terms of bushels\nof anything. But if an option expires in the money (ITM), the option will be\nautomatically exercised, and 100 shares per contract will be delivered to the\nbuyer or seller by the intermediation of the broker, depending on whether the\noption is a call or a put. On the other hand, commodities and futures con-\ntracts are similar to options in that they lock in the price and quantity of an\nasset and have expiration dates. But in both cases, you can trade away your\nrights and obligations if you exit the contract before expiration.\n» Indexes: Think of indexes as collections of assets whose value is pooled\ntogether to measure the price of the group.

Stocks, commodities, and futures\nare all index components. (Chapter 9 covers index options in detail.) Here is\nthe important difference: Indexes aren’t securities. That means you can’t buy\nan index directly. Instead, you buy securities that track the value of the index,\nsuch as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that own the stocks in\na particular index — for example, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index.\n» Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): ETFs are mutual funds that trade like stocks\non an exchange. Most ETFs are designed to track an index or an underlying\nsector of a particular market. ETFs aren’t derivatives, but they can be consid-\nered quasi-derivatives, or almost derivatives, because they don’t always hold\nthe exact same securities of the index that they track. For example, some\nleveraged ETFs use more exotic securities known as swaps to mimic the action\nof the underlying index while adding leverage. Two of the most popular ETFs\nare the S&P 500 SPDR (SPY) and the Powershares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which\ntracks the Nasdaq 100 index. These two popular ETFs let you trade their\nunderlying indexes, directly or through options.\n» Stocks and bonds: Stock ownership gives you part of a company, whereas\nbond ownership makes you a debt holder. Each dynamic has its own set of\nrisks and rewards. A comparison of the three assets, stocks, bonds, and\noptions, yields a fairly straightforward picture.

In the end, stocks offer indefinite holding periods, and\nbonds have a maturity date, whereas options have a limited life based on\ntheir expiration date.\nA swap is an insurance contract where terms are privately agreed upon by the\nparticipants. They can be thought of as nonexchange traded options, and they can\nbe used to bet on the direction of just about anything that the two parties agree\nupon. By design, swaps are sophisticated securities that aren’t available to indi-\nvidual investors because of the financial requirements and the specific agree-\nments required to be signed before you trade them.\nWhen you own shares in a leveraged ETF, check the prospectus to see whether\nyour ETF is a swap-containing vehicle. I’m not suggesting that you don’t consider\nleveraged ETFs if they make sense for your portfolio. I use them often in my per-\nsonal trading. It’s just important for you to always know what you’re investing in,\nespecially if it’s an indirect investment such as an ETF.\nWhen swaps get out of control, or malfunction, usually due to poor design or\ninsufficient collateralization where the counterparty can’t meet its obligation, the\nmarkets and your portfolio can suffer. That’s what happened in 2008 as lots of big\nmoney players bet (correctly) that subprime mortgage holders wouldn’t be able to\nmake their monthly mortgage payments. They were right, and the rest, as they\nsay, is history.\nValuing Options\nPart of knowing your risks and rewards results from understanding how an\ninvestment derives its value and what affects the rise and fall in its price. So here’s\nwhat you should know in order to value an option:\n» The type and strike price of the option (put or call)\n» The price of the underlying security\n» The characteristics of the past trading pattern of the underlying security: calm\nor volatile\n» The time remaining until the option expires\nThe following sections explain how to value options before you put your money\nin play.\nCHAPTER 2 Introducing Options 27",

By owning a call you have the right to\nbuy a certain stock at a pre-specified price by a certain date. Owning a put gives\nyou the right to sell a certain stock at a specific price by a certain date. Put option\nprices go up when the price of the underlying security falls. Call option prices\nshould rise when the underlying security’s price rises, but nothing is guaranteed\nbecause sometimes illiquid options (options with low trading volume) fail to move\nalong with the underlying stocks. When you own options, you can assert your\nrights at your own discretion.\nBetween the time you buy an option and its expiration date, you can\n» Sell the option prior to expiration. Do this if you have a profit.\n» Manually exercise it prior to expiration. Contact your broker.\n» Let it expire for either no value (for a loss) or for value (automatic exercise on\nyour behalf by your broker).\nAs an option seller, you’re obligated to complete a specific set of requirements. In\nfact, selling options gives you fewer choices, and the actionable choices are heav-\nily influenced by the action in the markets. As the expiration date nears, you can\n» Buy the option back for a profit before expiration.\n» Buy it back for a loss, especially when it’s early in the trade and you realize it’s\nnot going to work out. The trade isn’t going to make money. This is most likely\nto happen when the underlying stock goes ITM and the cost of buying the\noption back to close the trade is high enough to make the trade a loser.\n» Let the option expire with no value (for a profit). This is the ideal endpoint of\nselling options.\nIdentifying useful terms of endearment\nHere are several key terms you have to know in order to make good options trad-\ning decisions:\n» Underlying security (also known as the underlying): The stock that you buy\nor sell and that determines the value of the option.\n28 PART 1 Getting Started with Options Trading",

As day traders\nhave increased their participation in the options market, volume has swelled. This\nincrease in options volume affects the price of a stock because when you buy an\noption, the market makers, who are usually on the other side of the trade, sell an\noption and vice versa.\nHere’s how it works: If you buy an XYZ call option, the dealer (usually an algo)\ncreates the option and simultaneously buys the underlying stock. The dealer does\nthis in case someone exercises the option. If this happens, the dealer has to put up\nstock to cover the exercise. The net effect is that when the dealer buys the stock,\nwhich often makes the price rise, it causes more traders (day traders, algos, you,\nand me) to buy more call options or the underlying stock as the upside momentum\nbuilds.\nThe opposite happens with puts, which means that high levels of put buying can\nlead to a meaningful drop in the underlying stock.

The fol-\nlowing tips should help:\n» Get approval. When you want to start trading options, you need to get\napproval from your broker . . . the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC)\nrequires it. Your broker needs to make sure that trading these securities is\nappropriate for your financial situation and goals. It’s part of the process and\nmeans you typically get approved for basic option strategies if you haven’t\ntraded them in the past.\n» Be disciplined. When you enter a trade for a specific reason, such as an\nearnings announcement, pending economic report or a particular value for an\nindicator you use, you must exit the trade when conditions change or your\noriginal reason for purchasing the security no longer exists. Don’t let a stock\nor option position you intended to hold for three weeks become part of your\nlong-term portfolio.

When you purchase an option\nquoted at $2.80, you’re actually paying $280 for the option, plus commissions.\n» Market conditions: Different market conditions impact both the stock and\noptions markets. These include the following:\n• Trading halts for a security or entire market: If you hold options for a\nhalted stock, the options are also halted. You still have the ability to\nexercise your contract rights when this occurs before expiration. Generally,\na trading halt won’t restrict your right to exercise at all.\n• Fast trading conditions for a security or securities: When this happens,\nyou can expect to see quotes that are changing quickly, and you may\nexperience significant delays in order execution and reporting. Unless you\nmust exit a position for risk reasons, I strongly advise against using market\norders for options in fast markets.\n• Booked order: A booked order is one that improves the current market quote\nand updates it.",

You may encounter problems with such\norders because the size can be as small as one contract. If you enter a ten-\ncontract order that matches the booked order price, you may only be filled on\none contract. The rest of your order may or may not be filled.\n» Best-execution: Execution quality is a general term used to describe a broker’s\nability to provide trade completions at, or better than, the current market for the\nsecurity. That means that when you place an order to buy an option with an\nasking quote of $2.00, your order may be filled in a timely manner at $2.00 or\nbetter depending on liquidity and market conditions. Execution quality reports\nuse the National Best Bid or Offer (NBBO) for all exchanges trading the security.\nOption exchanges are required to send a daily report to your broker whenever a\ntrade is executed at a price other than the NBBO, referred to as traded-through.\nYour broker must also provide an exception reason for the trade-through. Even\nwith the reporting, you may feel you’re not getting the best possible executions\non your option trades.\nIf you aren’t satisfied with the execution you receive on a specific order, or if\nyou have an order that was marketable and is still open, contact your broker\nimmediately.

Here is\na closer look at these two rules:\n• SEC 11ac1-5 provides a monthly report on a variety of speed and execution mea-\nsurements for all orders (collectively) covered by the rule, which includes retail\norders for market and marketable limit orders that are received during regular trad-\ning hours, and specifically excludes orders with special handling requirements.\n• SEC 11ac1-6 is a quarterly reporting identifying where the brokerage firm sent its\ncovered order flow, along with any material relationships the firm has with that\nmarket venue (that is, any payment it receives from an exchange for its orders).",

An E/Q% of 98 percent indicates\na trade that was executed at a price better than the NBBO (price improvement),\nwhereas an E/Q% of 105 percent indicates a trade that was executed at a price that was\nworse than the NBBO (price disimprovement).\nThe time for order completion begins when the market center receives your order (the\ntrading department acting as market maker or specialist if your brokerage firm completes\nthat portion of the transaction). The time measurement ends when the order is executed\nin the marketplace, not when you receive the trade report back via the web or your broker.\nThe SEC requirements are specific, but there are enough vagaries for firms to highlight\ntheir strengths and downplay their weaknesses. You may find firms using best-ex\nreporting (referring to best exchange) as part of their marketing campaigns.

Furthermore,\nyou also need to be aware of the risks. The following sections identify the risks,\nlook at the related costs, and examine the benefits more closely.\nRecognizing option risks\nIf you’re trading options, make sure you’re aware of the following risks:\n» They have a limited lifespan and expire. If the option is in the money (ITM)\nat expiration, the option will be automatically exercised/assigned, which\nconverts a relatively low-cost option position into a high-cost stock position.\nConsequently, you need to monitor your ITM option positions near expiration\nin anticipation of this likely change in margin requirement and make trade\nadjustments if necessary to avoid or quickly remedy the conversion of options\ninto stock.\n» Options have the double-edged sword of leverage. Options don’t cost\nmuch, which means that they experience large percentage price moves in\nreaction to very small price moves of the underlying stock. This can result in\nhuge profits when the stock moves in the desired direction by a small amount,\nbut it can also result in a 100 percent loss if the stock moves in the wrong\ndirection by a small amount. That’s especially noticeable when trading too\nlarge a position size. Clearly, leverage is a risk that needs to be addressed —\nwhich, of course, I do throughout the book.",

For stock options, you want to\nconsider the likelihood a particular option will be ITM at expiration given the type\nof price movements the underlying stock has experienced in the past.\nIdentifying costs unique to options\nBecause options are a little different from other securities, recognizing that they\nhave certain characteristics that make them more expensive than trading more\ncommonly held securities such as stocks is important. The main costs to consider\ninclude the following:\n» Liquidity: The ease with which you can enter and exit a trade without impacting\nits price, varies by option. Low liquidity securities are more expensive and can be\nriskier because the option price may move rapidly, especially to the downside.\n» Time: The more time you’re purchasing, the greater the cost of the option.\n» Volatility: Stocks with greater price movement in the past are expected to\ncontinue such movement in the future. The more volatile the underlying\nstock, the more expensive the option will be.\nThis section covers the ways each of these items impacts your trading costs.\nPaying for less liquidity\nAlthough many option contracts are actively traded with high open interest, the\nsheer number of contracts available to trade means there will also be those that\nhave limited daily volume and open interest levels.",

When liquidity is\nlow, the spread widens. Slippage is the trading term associated with money lost\ndue to the spread. The best way to think about this cost is if you were to buy on the\nask and then immediately turn around and sell the option on the bid, you’d have\na loss — called slippage.\nLiquidity saves you money.

Generally, the cost of time for an option increases if the stock has\nproven to be more volatile in the past.\nValuing options benefits\nBy keeping the rights associated with a particular option type straight, you can often\nquickly estimate an option’s value from the option’s strike price and the market\nprice of the stock.

Most option exchange\nwebsites and charting services provide this tool.\nUsing an option calculator, you enter the price of the underlying stock, the option\nstrike price, the time to expiration, and the option quote.

Option price changes attributable to interest\nrates are much smaller, so this last measure receives less coverage.\nOption valuation models can be used to determine whether a particular option is\nrelatively expensive or cheap. A model is best applied when you understand its\nassumptions and recognize that the Greeks provide expected values that by no\nmeans guarantee the future.\nDelta\nDelta is probably the most important Greek value for you to initially understand\nbecause it connects changes in the underlying stock’s value directly to changes in\nthe option value.

Moreover, measure risk not just by the possibility that you may lose, but also\nby the amount of the potential loss, which is why option strategies, when used\ncorrectly, are better risk-management tools than other investments.\nTraditionally, successful, professional, and experienced traders at any level decide\nwhen they’re going to exit a position before they enter a trade through either\nplacing a stop loss or by setting a price target where they’ll either take partial\nprofits or exit the position, if the trade moves in the right direction. And though\nthat remains an excellent idea and practice, how the strategy and the process of\nputting together a sound trading plan are carried out is even more important.\nThat’s because whether you use an advanced automated order designed to get you\nout of a position or choose to execute the exit manually, stocks may gap down (that\nis, open for trading significantly below the previous day’s closing price) below\nyour pre-decided exit level and lead you to greater losses than you planned for.\nEven worse, if you’re planning a manual exit, the hit to your position may be even\ngreater. In fact, price surprises, either at the open, the close, or during the trading\nday are much more common in the present because they’re often triggered by\nkeywords in news releases and other techniques used by algos).\nCHAPTER 4 Identifying Option Risks and Rewards 57",

If you use margin, you can lose more than what you started with. That\nmeans in order to avoid catastrophic losses, you need to recognize the fact that\nyou could lose large amounts of money, and you need to be aware of how such a\nsituation could develop in order to reduce the odds of it happening to you.\nThis chapter explores the relationship between risks and rewards and discusses how\nto manage them so you can trade another day. Indeed, the use of options, by design,\nis an excellent risk-management tool for the times in which we live and trade.\nUnderstanding Your Trading Risks\nRisk and reward are related but can be, and often are, lopsided. For example, not\nall risk-reward profiles are equal, even in trades that may, at face value, seem\nsimilar. The fact is that given two different trades, you can face a lot more risk in\none trade compared to the other — even if both trades share similar reward\npotential. The final outcome depends on the risk characteristics of the security\nyou trade. So, in order to understand your risk, you should know the following\nbefore you trade:\n» The maximum amount of loss possible\n» The probability of sustaining a loss\nAny pro will tell you, if you want to hang around as a trader, you’ll spend a lot of\ntime mapping out your potential risks.

The worst scenario is when prices\nfall and losses add up through extended downward moves. And although the price\nof stocks will rise and fall, it’s possible that you may buy in on a really bad day,\njust when ABC starts on a prolonged down trend. An even worse scenario is that\nABC stops trading, due to a major event, preventing you from exiting at any level.\nAlthough you’ll likely exit a trade at some point, the fact remains that when you\nbuy a stock with 100 percent cash, the stock can move downward to zero, resulting\nin a complete loss of your investment. So the maximum risk you have when buy-\ning a stock is\n# of Shares × Price of Stock = Risk\nMargin has pluses and minuses and is generally not something I recommend.\nPurchasing a stock on margin provides you with leverage, allowing you to own\nmore stock for a set initial investment.",

(For more on margin, see Chapter 8.)\nAssuming you purchased ABC on margin rather than using 100 percent cash, your\nrisk doubles by 1 divided by the initial cash percentage, or 1 divided by 0.50 = 2.\nWelcome to leverage.\nTo calculate your maximum risk when buying stock on margin, you can start by\nmultiplying the initial investment by 1 divided by the initial margin percentage.\nThen add the cost of using margin, which is the margin interest rate for the stock\nholding period.\nThe maximum risk you have when buying a stock using margin is\nRisk = (# of Shares × Price of Stock) × (1 ÷ Initial Cash %)\nCHAPTER 4 Identifying Option Risks and Rewards 59",

For example, if you want\nto borrow $10,000 and the margin interest is 5 percent, you’d borrow $500 if you\nborrowed the money for a year. Wall Street uses 360 days to calculate interest.\nThus, for example, if you borrowed the money for 20 days, divide $500 by 20,\nwhich equals $25. In this case, your margin cost would be $25.\nShort stock\nWhen you short a stock, you’re doing so in the hope that the stock will drop in\nprice, so you reverse the order of the typical stock transaction. Rather than buying\nfirst and selling later, you sell first and buy the stock later.\nThere is a method to the madness, though. To sell a stock you don’t own, you need\nto borrow the shares from your broker. But depending on market conditions,\nshares may or may not be available to you for selling short. Thus, always check\nyour broker’s short sale list or contact them directly to determine whether you can\nmake the transaction based on availability of shares. Traders using brokers that\nspecialize in active trading accounts will likely find it to be less of a problem.\nOnline brokers make short selling easy.

Although a credit is received for the sale of stock, you may have to deal\nwith other margin issues, so make sure you understand the process thoroughly\nbefore making any real trades.\nWhere does that put you in terms of risk? Selling stocks short is an extremely\nhigh-risk trading strategy, especially because after the algos see that you’re\nshorting the stock, they’ll find a way to make that stock’s price rise in order to\ntake you out. Also, because there is no limit to how high a stock can move upward,\nshorting a stock is an unlimited risk strategy. Granted, you can buy back a stock\nbefore it goes to infinity and beyond, but in the same way a stock can gap down, it\ncan gap up.

It’s limited because a\nstock can only move down to zero; it can’t trade below that. The risk remains high\nbecause a stock can do just that — move to zero. This risk increases when margin\nis used and creates a situation where you can lose more than your initial\ninvestment.\nCalculating option risks\nBuying both call and put options has risk that is limited to the initial investment.\nSelling options has much more risk and can incur losses greater than the initial\ninvestment. This initial investment can vary in size, but whether you’re buying or\nselling options, it’s less than the investment required to control the same number\nof shares of the underlying stock. Although the risk is relatively smaller in terms\nof dollars, make sure you recognize that the likelihood that an option you buy will\ngo to zero is much higher than the underlying stock going to zero.\nThe chance that an option will go to zero is 100 percent because an option is a\nlimited life security that eventually expires.",

As I note in Chapter 14, other approaches\nallow you to benefit from downward or sideways moves in the stock.\nLong stock\nWhen you buy stock in the market, you create a long stock position.

In addition, a stock’s price must\n» Rise above the breakeven for call option profits to kick in\n» Fall below the breakeven for put option profits to kick in\nIn each case, this results in profits that are slightly less than your stock profits\nbecause of the influence of time value on the price of options.\nA stock’s breakeven point is your purchase price when buying stock or your sell\nprice when shorting a stock. As soon as the stock moves away from this price, you\nhave gains or losses.\nCall option\nPurchasing a call option gives you rights to buy stock at a certain level. As a result,\nthe option increases in value when the stock’s price moves upward. After a stock\nmoves above your call option’s strike price, the option has intrinsic value, which\nincreases as the stock continues to rise.

At this level, option premiums\nwill minimally equal your cost when you bought the call.\nThe breakeven for a call option is\nCall Breakeven = Call Strike Price + Call Purchase Premium\nAfter a stock’s price is at the option’s breakeven level, it can continue to rise\nindefinitely. Your call option can similarly rise indefinitely until expiration. As a\nresult, call option profits are considered to be unlimited, just like stock.\nAn option’s moneyness is determined by the option type and the price of the under-\nlying stock relative to the option strike price.

By doing this, you can quickly assess strategies you\nalready use as well as new ones. Risk graphs or risk profiles are graphical views of\npotential risks and rewards in option trading. You can create a generic graph that\nexcludes prices to identify the risks and rewards for any asset type. You can also\ncreate a more specific risk graph that includes stock price levels, with breakeven\nlevels, profits, and losses for a particular position.\nCHAPTER 4 Identifying Option Risks and Rewards 65",

The opposite is true for\nfalling markets. Because of the way algos work, especially when there is increased\nvolatility during any given trading day or short period of time, trends can often\nlast longer than anyone expects, which means that the ability to judge the validity\nof price and trend turning points is more important than ever.\nBecause options volume often dwarfs stock volume options, market trading data\nhas become an increasingly important tool to gauge the health of a stock market\nmove.

The hallmark of success with any type of analysis is\nto be aware of when each specific indicator is delivering extreme readings. Using\npast data to identify atypical readings, you can often identify levels associated\nwith unsustainable advances or declines. In this chapter, I look at how the algos\nwork, the clues they leave behind, and how you can use them profitably.\nConsidering a Few Words about\nSelect Macro Factors\nBefore I jump into the markets themselves, consider the following factors:\n» Interest rates: Generally, low or falling interest rates are bullish for stocks,\nand rising interest rates are eventually negative. This may seem like needless\ninformation, but if history is any guide, the general trend of interest rates can\naffect the price of underlying stocks, which will affect the price of your options.\nKeeping your eye on interest rates all over the world makes sense. In the past,\nthe U.S. Federal Reserve was the only central bank in the world with enough\npower to influence global markets. Presently, because all markets are linked,\nother central banks, specifically the People’s Bank of China and the European\nCentral Bank’s actions can also be market movers, although the U.S. Federal\nReserve is still the most influential.\nDon’t fight the Fed because the algos certainly don’t.",

Any hint that interest rates\nare going to rise usually brings on heavy algo selling.\n» Global economic trends: In the first 16 years of the 21st century, the global\neconomy was mostly synchronized. During that period, the economies of\nChina, Europe, and the United States had been the leaders and could be\ncounted on as a block. This changed significantly after the U.K.’s exit from the\nEuropean Union (called Brexit), the election of Donald J. Trump as the\nPresident of the United States, and the COVID pandemic.

Where\nin the past each individual market would often act independently from other\nmarkets, in the present each separate market is a component of what has\nevolved into one single “market.” This is because the activity and interaction\nbetween the algos in one area, such as the bond market, often affect money\nflows in and out of commodity, foreign exchange, stocks, and options — often\nsimultaneously. Specifically, it’s due to the fact that algo trading programs\noften involve more than one market simultaneously, such as when they sell\nstocks at the same time that they’re buying bonds. This in turn may trigger\nactivity in commodities and currencies. Thus, what happens in one market can\neasily, and often, affect the rest in a meaningful way at any time.\nThus, although much of this chapter is geared toward technical analysis, make\nsure you keep an eye on these important external factors, specifically because\nthey’re major components in the programming of trading algos and because they\naffect their programming and thus the direction of the markets.\nAssessing the Market’s (the Algos’) Bias\nMarket old-timers (like me) have often said the market’s main job is to make\ninvestors look foolish as often as possible.",

At the same time, the beauty of this startling fact is that the algos\nleave their footprints everywhere. If you know what to look for, you can use it to\nmake better trading decisions.\nFor example, you might expect a decline when weak economic numbers are\nreleased only to be surprised by the rally that follows. Or you’re certain that you’ll\nsee a boring day after a widely held company releases a profitable earnings report,\nand then your jaw drops with the ensuing decline that’s attributed to this news.\nAnd although you can’t ever be 100 percent certain about any market event or\nresponse, you can be better prepared by following market breadth and options\ntrading data.

You can see excellent examples in\nFigure 5-1 in March, June, November, and December 2020.\nRSI, ROC, AND MARKET BOTTOMS\nRSI is a measure of the market being overbought or oversold. When applied to the\nAdv-Dec line, it gives early clues as to whether the broad market is oversold or\noverbought and whether a reversal is likely. That’s important because very low\nreadings in the RSI as related to the Adv-Dec line generally mark a market bottom\nor an upside reversal, whereas very high readings generally mark a market top or\na downside reversal.\nRSI readings near 30 are reliable signs that the market is oversold. The three RSI\nimportant numbers to become familiar with are as follows:\n» 30 (oversold)\n» 50 (intermediate support)\n» 70 (overbought)\nThe ROC indicator is considered overbought with readings above 5–6, and over-\nsold at readings of (–)5 to (–6), whereas the 0 point corresponds to the 50 point\non RSI (intermediate support).\nFigure 5-1 shows two textbook cases of RSI oversold readings: Dec. 2019 and\nMarch 2020.

In the 1980s and 1990s, two widely disseminated surveys handled it:\n• Investor’s Intelligence\n• American Association of Individual Investor’s (AAII)\nYou looked for high levels of bullishness or bearishness and decided whether a top or a\nbottom was near. Much of the time, they were helpful. Of course, they aren’t very useful\nanymore. And that’s because the algos can’t be surveyed.\nThe truth is that old fashioned sentiment analysis, although helpful and useful, was an\ninexact endeavor, and it doesn’t work anymore. Now you have to use direct algo data to\nderive clues about market turning points.\nToday sentiment is still the same because you’re looking to identify periods when\ngreed has gotten unsustainable (market top) or fear is just about exhausted (mar-\nket bottom).

When the flow of options changes from call buying to\nput buying, they reverse their hedging by selling puts and selling stock index\nfutures and the market falls.

If you’re more\nexperienced, this section is a good review.\nUnderstanding chart basics\nCharts, more formally known as price charts, are visual records of price activity:\npictures formed by the periodic plotting of price data so you can see trading activ-\nity over time, whether days, weeks, years, or minutes. A short list of common\nchart types includes the following:\n» Line chart: Documents price movement versus time. A single price data point\n(dot) for each period is connected using a line. Line charts typically plot closing\nprice values, which are generally considered the most important value for the\nperiod (day, week, and so on).",

Line charts typically plot closing\nprice values, which are generally considered the most important value for the\nperiod (day, week, and so on). Line charts are easy to interpret and provide\ngreat big picture information for price movement and trends by filtering out\nnoise from more minor moves during the period.\nDisadvantages to line charts include the fact that they provide no information\nabout the strength of trading during the day or whether price gaps occurred\nfrom one period to the next. A price gap is created when trading for one\nperiod is completely above or below trading for the previous period. This\nhappens when significant news impacting the company comes out when the\nmarkets are closed. Doesn’t that seem like good information for you to have\nwhen you’re trading?\n» Open-high-low-close (OHLC) bar chart: Pictures price versus time. The\nperiod’s trading range (low to high) is displayed as a vertical line with opening\nprices displayed as a horizontal tab on the left side of the range bar and\nclosing prices as a horizontal tab on the right side of the range bar. A total of\nfour price points are used to construct each bar.\nOHLC charts are more complete and useful over different periods of time\nbecause they provide information about both trading period strength and\nprice gaps. For example, when analyzing a daily chart as a point of reference,\na relatively long vertical bar tells you the price range was pretty big for the\n94 PART 2 Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies",

They also plot price versus time and are similar to an OHLC\nchart with the price range between the open and the close for the period\nhighlighted by a thickened bar. Patterns unique to this chart can enhance\ndaily analysis.\nCandlestick charts have distinct pattern interpretations describing the battle\nbetween bulls and bears. They’re best applied to a daily chart.

Think about your objective. What you\nwant to view when evaluating your 401(k) investment is different from your focus\nfor active trading.\nTechnical analysis places different emphasis on time frames. Longer-term trends\nare considered stronger than shorter-term ones. When looking for trends, evalu-\nate charts that depict price action over multiple intervals of time. The typical chart\ndefault is a daily chart, which plots the price action on a daily basis. Other chart\nperiods include weeks, months, and years. Day traders often use charts that mea-\nsure minutes.\nCHAPTER 6 Sector Analysis: Technical and Fundamental 95",

At the same time,\ndue to the potentially rapid changes in trends due to algo strategies, make sure\nyou become proficient in reading and analyzing charts for all time periods includ-\ning intraday charts that focus on price changes taking place over minutes. Spe-\ncifically, intraday charts are best used for picking entry and exit points for\nindividual trades.\nVisualizing supply and demand\nCharts can be thought of as a visual display of supply and demand:\n» Buying demand pushes prices upward.\n» Supply creates selling pressure that drives prices downward.\n» Volume displays the magnitude of supply or demand.\nMarkets don’t just move straight up and down — price variations are a direct\nresult of the constant and dynamic battle between the bulls (demand) and the\nbears (supply).\nMoreover, in the age of algos important price areas such as support and resis-\ntance, as I describe in the next sections are very important. That’s because you can\nbe sure that when prices hold at key support or move above heavy resistance, the\nodds are that the algos played a big role in that price movement. And you don’t\nwant to trade against the algos.\nAreas of support and resistance\nPrice support and resistance halt the trend that is in place:\n» Support is a chart area where buyers come into a falling trend. It represents a\ntransition from declining prices driven by supply to climbing prices when\nrenewed demand kicks in at that price level.\n96 PART 2 Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies",

It represents a\ntransition from climbing prices driven by strong demand to declining prices\nwhen selling pressure comes in at that price.\nWhen trading, notice that these transitions line up over time, sometimes creating\nsideways trading channels as price moves between the two. As with all price\ntrends, the longer the price serves as support or resistance, the stronger it’s\nconsidered.\nSupport and resistance levels aren’t just chart points to look at; they’re areas\nwhere you can take action. For example, support and resistance levels are useful\nfor identifying trading position entry and exit points. Consider also using them in\nprice projections to identify stop-loss and profit-taking exits as well as calculat-\ning risk-reward ratios.\nFurthermore, when price breaks occur above or below key support and resistance\nlevels are accompanied by above average volume, it’s usually a sign that whatever\ncomes next will likely be a lasting move.\nPrice areas that previously served as support often serve as resistance areas in the\nfuture and vice versa. When prices rise above resistance or fall below support, it’s\na signal that a new price trend may be on the way.\nTrend analysis\nRegardless of how simplistic it may sound, the trend is most definitely your friend.\nAnd in the age of algo trading, the most profitable trades are those that remain in\nplace for extended periods of time due to the continued buying by the algos, which\nin turns extends the trend.",

As a result, recognizing the dominant price trend is,\nmore than ever, crucial to profitable trading.\nIndeed, the term “trend” identifies price direction:\n» Upward trend: Prices climb and pull back in such a way that a rising line can\nbe drawn under the pullbacks, which display higher lows. Higher highs are\nalso characteristic of uptrends.\n» Downward trend: Prices fall and retrace in such a way that a declining line\ncan be drawn above the top of retracement peaks that display lower highs.\nLower lows are also characteristic of downtrends.\nCreate a trendline by connecting two higher lows (uptrend) or two lower highs\n(downtrend). When price successfully tests the line a third time, the trend is con-\nfirmed.

These lines are considered lagging indica-\ntors because the historical data follows price action. Here are the two main types\nof moving averages:\n» Simple moving averages (SMAs) use a basic average calculation.\n» Exponential moving averages (EMAs) incorporate all available price data,\nproviding greater weight to more recent data.\nSMAs equally weigh all closes for the time period selected, whereas EMAs are cal-\nculated in such a way that more recent data carries greater weight in the line.\nAlgo trading strategies usually include some sort of moving average instructions,\nwhich means that volatility often increases when stocks or indices reach those\nimportant chart points. For example, when trading options occur on SPY, you may\nnotice that prices tend to move more rapidly near the 20- and the 50-day moving\naverages.

In other words, if prices rise or fall\nabove key moving averages or respective Bollinger Bands (see “Analyzing volatil-\nity with Bollinger Bands later in this chapter), you need to consider the possibility\nof a price reversal and take the appropriate action in order to profit.\nBoth SMAs and EMAs can be constructed using a variety of settings and chart\nintervals, so you can view a five-day SMA on a daily chart or a ten-week EMA on\na weekly chart. Moving average lines are considered unbiased trend indicators\nbecause the lines are derived from objective calculations.\nThe traditionally most common settings for either moving average include the\nfollowing:\n» 20-day moving average displaying short-term trends\n» 50-day moving average displaying intermediate-term trends\n» 200-day moving average displaying long-term trends\n98 PART 2 Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies",

Your objec-\ntive as an options trader is to find those relatively strong and weak groups so you\ncan apply profitable sector strategies using options.\nWhen designing long strategies your best bets are to go with the strongest possi-\nble sectors. I show you how to find them in the following sections.\nRelative ratios\nYou construct a relative ratio line by dividing one security into another. Doing so\nallows you to objectively compare the performance of one security relative to the\nother, because the line rises when the primary security is outperforming the sec-\nond one and falls when it is underperforming. Adding an overlay chart to a relative\nratio allows you to view both securities on one chart.

The main goal is to develop a group of ETFs that\nexperience related capital inflows and outflows.\nFocusing on ROC trends\nROC and other technical indicators are confirming indicators whereas price is the\nultimate indicator.

Because various time periods\ncan be used on a chart, HV reflects the chart period, not necessarily a daily\ncalculation as you see on option HV or SV charts.\n» Average true range (ATR): Welles Wilder developed ATR, which uses a true\nrange (TR) value to define price movement. TR incorporates extreme move-\nment such as gaps, so it better reflects volatility. TR uses the previous close\nand current high and low values to calculate three different ranges.

It allows compari-\nsons for securities with different prices by creating a value that is independent of\nprice. Figure 6-2 provides the three TR range calculations and a bar chart example\nof each.\nATR is an exponential moving average that smooths TR. A strong move in the ATR\nincorporates price gaps and provides traders with important information about\nprice volatility that can be missed by other smoothed indicators. Because ATR uses\nhistorical prices and a smoothing process, it’s a lagging indicator and does not\npredict volatility. However, a sharp move upward in a security’s ATR is often\naccompanied by an increase in IV for its options.\nCHAPTER 6 Sector Analysis: Technical and Fundamental 105",

Gann’s ratios\ninclude 0.125, 0.25, 0.50, and 1.00, among others.\nFibonacci series and ratios\nThe Fibonacci integer series is generated starting with 0 and 1, and adding the two\nprevious integers in the series to obtain the next integer:\n0, 1, 1 (0 + 1), 2 (1 + 1), 3 (1 + 2), 5 (2 + 3), 8 (3 + 5), 13 (5 + 8), . . .\nThe Fibonacci ratios are values reached when dividing an integer in the series by\nspecific previous or subsequent integers in the series. The primary Fibonacci\nratios used in technical analysis are as follows:\n0.382, 0.500, 0.618, 1.00, 1.618 and 2.618\nBecause prices don’t move straight up or down, retracements develop which are\ncounter-trend moves. A retracement includes\n» A pullback in price during an uptrend\n» A rise in price during a downtrend\nFibonacci ratios are often used to define and predict potential retracement areas.\nExtensions use the same ratio process to identify projections beyond the starting\npoint for the base trend.\nFibonacci numbers can be used for indicator settings when making adjustments to\nthe default setting.\nFigure 6-8 displays Fibonacci retracements (thinner lines occurring during the\ntrend) and extensions (thicker lines occurring beyond the trend) for XLI.\nTime extensions\nA second method uses Fibonacci numbers or ratios to identify future dates for\npotential turning points.

Cycle analysis can\nbe imprecise and variable, whereas Fibonacci analysis is more reliable.\nProjections and probabilities\nBy lining up different high probability factors, you create a situation where you\nput the odds in your favor for a particular strategy or trade.

The key is\nto let both art and science balance each other and to take hope, emotion, and ego\nout of the picture.\nWeighing possibility versus probability\nEven though basic tools can be subjective, at least trust what you see and develop\nreliable rules for those times when what you see isn’t totally clear. For example, a\nvalid trendline helps you more easily identify intact trends and provides a reason-\nable exit point when the line is broken. Such a break is a clear signal that the origi-\nnal reason for entering the trade is no longer valid.

Repetition — the\nkey to rewiring the brain — is a great way to make sure everything is as it should\nbe for pro athletes.

Furthermore, the Dodgers don’t let anyone play\nwho’s not a proven pro and who’s not shown he can deliver the goods. So, practic-\ning some trading (called paper trading) before you put real money on the line\nmakes sense.\nSure, paper trading may sound like watching paint dry, but the point is to hone\nyour trading technique, before pulling the real money trigger.

In effect, you’re transi-\ntioning from concept to action.\nWhen paper trading to learn the tricks of a new strategy, do it with an extremely\nliquid option, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). This ETF is very popular\nwith heavy volume, a fact that helps you learn the basics of any strategy faster and\nmore completely than if you monitored a slower trading set of options.\nMonitoring Option Greek Changes\nUnderstanding basic option strategies is a much quicker learning curve than rec-\nognizing the proper pricing for options used in those strategies. Chapters 3, 14,\nand 15 discuss theoretical models and conditions impacting option premiums. But\none of the best ways to really grasp the value of these securities is by monitoring\nprice and Greek changes under actual conditions. (See Chapter 3 for more on the\nGreeks.)\nThe bottom line is that the Greeks are excellent measures of what the price of the\noption is likely to do in the future. Having a thorough understanding of what they\nare and their relationship to one another is central to options trading. Thus, when\nyou paper trade, paying attention to the Greeks is an excellent habit to develop,\nand the following sections can help.\nTracking premium measures\nDeveloping your skills with any option strategy means understanding how option\npremiums are impacted by changes in both of the following:\n» The price of the underlying\n» Time to expiration\nIt’s time to get active, and a great way to get a better intuitive feel for the impact\nfrom both of these factors is by formally tracking changes in all the different\n124 PART 2 Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies",

In fact, in\nsome cases, watching the options as they trade during the day with a real-time\nquote program such as the ones that options brokers provide is the best strategy.\nBy watching the changes in prices in real time you can start to get a much finer\nfeel for how your strategies may pan out.\nGenerally, all you need in order to do this is access to market prices, an option\ncalculator, and a spreadsheet program. By monitoring a few different options\n(such as SPY), you should be able to learn a lot about how changing conditions\nimpact prices in general. By including Greeks in the process, you also understand\nwhich factors play more significant roles in the way prices evolve at different\ntimes.\nIndeed, price movement is the key, which is why I recommend using an active\noptions series like those linked with SPY for this purpose. Doing so helps highlight\ndelta, gamma, and theta impacts on price.

The following sections help clarify some of the volatility\nterminology.\nGetting a grip on historical volatility\nHistorical (past) volatility (HV) is a measure of the underlying stock’s actual price\nmovement. Historical volatility of a stock can be a predictor of future or implied\nvolatility in the same stock’s price in the future. Moreover, a major factor in the\nactual volatility of a stock is how the price of options affects it.\nUnderstanding implied volatility (IV)\nImplied (future) volatility (IV) is a measure of the underlying stock’s potential price\nmovement and is derived from option prices.

At the\nsame time periods of low implied volatility, when combined with technical analy-\nsis and event timing, can offer excellent entry points into options, whereas\nextended periods of high volatility can often offer excellent exit points. See\nChapter 6 for more on technical analysis.\nA volatility of 30 percent for a stock priced at $100 means that you may see the\nprice of the stock to trade between $70 and $130 over the next year. The actual\nprice movement is dependent upon one standard deviation of the stock’s price,\nwhich when normally distributed is 68.2 percent.\nThink of these “rules” more as guidelines, which means be aware of them and\nimplement them when possible, while considering that nothing is 100 percent\neffective when trading stocks or options. For example, when holding a long-term\nstock position you want to protect, should you just throw caution to the wind\nbecause put IV is high?

Definitely not, especially when you consider that increas-\ning IV often translates to increasing fear in the market. When faced with buying\noptions in a high-volatility environment, you may need to evaluate a broader\nrange of expiration months and strike prices.\nWhen IV is relatively high and then drops significantly, it’s referred to as an\nIV crush. This type of occurrence is usually event driven and is a response to news\nsuch as earnings reports, a major change in a company’s leadership, or product\nlaunches. When the event becomes a reality, it’s no longer an uncertainty, which\nreduces its effect on the options price. Yet, because trading doesn’t have any guar-\nantees, keep in mind that the news itself may have caused a significant price move\nin the stock. Selling high IV options in the hopes for an IV crush is a dangerous\nstrategy because the option value could move significantly due to actual stock\nprice movement, even though IV declines after the news event has occurred.\nRemember that IV can vary in the following ways:\n» By time to expiration: This is due to inherent designs with pricing model\ndesign, which is beyond the scope of this discussion, but it needs to be stated\nbecause this factor is a part of real-time trading, and it does affect the option\nCHAPTER 7 Practicing Before You Swing 127",

In practice, a higher IV in one expiration\nmeans the stock is likely to move by a greater percentage during that\nexpiration than other expirations.\n» By strike price: Usually ATM IV is the lowest. Skew charts (refer to Chapter 15)\nprovide IV by strike price and can speed up the option-selection process when\nyou need to purchase contracts while IV is relatively high. An option price can\nbe broken into two components: intrinsic and extrinsic value. The intrinsic\nvalue is completely determined by the option moneyness, the difference\nbetween strike price and the current stock price, but IV doesn’t play a role in\nthis value. The deeper ITM the option is, the less impact IV will have on the\ntotal option premium. That’s because IV is the primary determinant of time\nvalue, which along with intrinsic value determine the option’s price.\nWhen using short option strategies, time value works in your favor because deep\nITM options have little time value. Selling options with 30 to 45 days to expiration\naccelerates this time-value decay for you.

Even if you\ncurrently use a systematic approach to a strategy — such as only purchasing a call\nwhen implied volatility is relatively low — a trading system is more rigidly\ndefined. When using a system, you should do the following:\n» Establish a position for all buy signals generated by the rules.\n» Exit each position when the exit signal is generated.\nGetting used to following your new trading system rules can lead to more frequent\ntrading, especially during volatile markets. Factor your time commitments and\nother potential changes as required into your daily routine.\nIn fact, because a trading system is a set of rules, I like to think of them as a coun-\nter to the algos’ programming.

What’s important is that you’re comfortable with fol-\nlowing the rules you build into them.

The bottom line is that you’re\nlooking for consistency. You don’t want to fool yourself into thinking that your\nsystem is good when in fact all you’re doing is getting lucky in a big way once in\na while. After creating a system that performs reasonably in backtests, you com-\nplete forward testing by running the rules on a shorter period of time via paper\ntrading. Generally you start the test at the latest backtest date and run it to some\npoint in time before implementation. Expect diminishing returns during forward\ntesting.\nOf course, nothing is perfect, and system trading isn’t a secret key that unlocks\nprofits. However, it’s a way you can minimize harmful trading emotions and\ndeliver more consistent results.\nFollowing the right steps\nHere are the steps you should take when backtesting a system:\n1.\nIdentify basis of strategy (for example, capture trending conditions).\n2.\nIdentify trade entry and exit rules.\n3.\nIdentify market traded and period backtest.\n4.\nIdentify account assumptions (system and trade allocations).\n5.\nTest system, evaluate results.\n6.\nIdentify reasonable filters to minimize losing trades (number and/or size\nof such trades).\n7.\nAdd filter based on conclusions from Step 6, test system, and then\nevaluate results.\n132 PART 2 Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies",

That’s a net profit of\n$500. And if that’s the case, then your system is worthwhile because it got you out\nof the bad trades and kept you in the good ones. Moreover, you should update the\nsystem based on your two good trades as well as keep the parts of it that got you\nout of the bad trades.\nAdding risk management to a backtest\nAll trade approaches need to take risk management into account.

If adding this stop maintains profitability and stability of the\nsystem and is consistent with your risk tolerance, you can consider implementing\nthe strategy or system.\nCutting losses\nAn approach that is systematic, but not mechanical, can still be backtested.\nRegardless of how you go about performing that backtest, you should keep an eye\non large adverse moves that occurred for the trades generated. Doing so allows\nyou to identify reasonable, systematic filters and stops geared toward minimizing\nlosses.\nA stop-loss order can result in a larger percentage loss by the time a trade is\nexecuted.

Right around that point you realize you don’t have\na specific exit plan for taking profits. Sometimes you focus so much on risk that\nyou forget to identify favorable price targets. Or maybe you do identify a profitable\nexit point, but conditions start to deteriorate before that price level is reached.\nHere is how to take care of that problem: In addition to identifying a stop-loss\nlevel, identify a trailing stop percentage or dollar amount to minimize the number\nof profitable trades that turn into losses. The trailing stop should be incorporated\ninto your system or strategy and tested. If you want the system to generate the\ntrailing amount, evaluate trades with large favorable moves that yielded signifi-\ncantly less in the way of profits (or turned into losses). After completing your\nreview, you may do as follows:\n» Add a filter that accelerates your exits.\n» Generate a trailing percentage using MAE percentage data.\nLetting profits run\nAn effective trading approach doesn’t necessarily have to have more winning\ntrades than losing trades.

Minimizing\nthem — not eliminating them — by managing risk is your goal, because eliminat-\ning them isn’t realistic. You can minimize risk best by determining proper trade\nallocation amounts and maximum loss per trade. And although effectively execut-\ning trades is another step toward minimizing losses, putting together a reliable\ntrading plan is the beginning of a successful trading career. I start with plan\ndevelopment and cover key related topics in this chapter.\nCHAPTER 8 Designing a Killer Trading Plan 143",

Having a big picture and a detailed set of goals to fill in the\ngaps is a good start. You can begin with a guiding statement like “I’d like to make\nmoney on a consistent basis.” After you have your big picture, you can build more\ndetail into the plan. When you’re just starting, designing a trading plan around a\nsingle purpose, such as making your car payment from your trading proceeds, is\na good way to measure your success. If you make your goal, you’ve been success-\nful. If you don’t make your goal, it’s a signal that your expectations are too lofty\nor your trading isn’t compatible with your goal. The key is to have a reliable and\nquantifiable way to measure success or failure beyond the traditional measures\nsuch as yearly percentage gains or losses.\nHere are some helpful guidelines:\n» Write it down. A verbal trading plan is no good. Put it in writing and put the\npaper somewhere visible so it reminds you of your purpose.\n» Set realistic goals. If you have a small account, don’t set your goal too high.\nInstead of a car payment, make your goal going out to a casual restaurant\nwith your significant other once a month or something else that makes sense\nto you.\n» Use the goal as a measuring stick. If you don’t meet your goal but you still\nmade money, then you’re on the right track.",

If you’re fortunate and diligent and become a profitable trader,\nconsider transitioning into trading full time or a significant portion of the time.\n» Think like a market maker. When you place an order, keep in mind what the\nparty on the other side of the trade is doing and how it could affect both your\ntrade and the market. Specifically, if you’re following a trend — meaning that\nthere is large volume in the options contract you’re trading — keep an eye on\nthe price of the underlying stock and on the price of the option you just\nbought and how it reacts to trading activity.\n144 PART 2 Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies",

If trading becomes a significant part of your income, then you can add\nmore expenses to your tax returns, such as traveling to trading conferences.\nManaging Your Costs\nNothing in this world is free, so you have to consider a variety of costs with your\ntrading; some are higher when you first start and many continue throughout your\ncareer. You should view trading as a business and manage these expenses so you\ncan minimize them and their effect on how much money you actually earn as a\ntrader as your business matures. The expense categories in the following list will\nall continue throughout your trading career, but some will begin higher than\nothers:\n» Education: Education expenses include materials, courses, and learning curve\ncosts for new markets and strategies. These costs will decrease as time\nprogresses, but costs of some sort will remain ongoing as you stay current\nwith market conditions (books, periodicals, website subscriptions, online\ncourses, and so on) and continue to develop new strategies.\n» One of the largest education costs is your learning curve.

Slippage is the cost associated with the market spread — the\ndifference between the bid and the ask. A good exercise is to calculate\ncommission and slippage percentages for different size option positions\n(for example, one, five, ten contracts) established at different price points\n($1, $5, $10).\nIf you borrow from your broker via trading on margin, you need to add\nmonthly margin interest charges to your trading costs as well. Short option\npositions have margin requirements that can get complicated. The main\nconsideration for this margin is whether the option is covered or naked. If you\ndecide to move forward with strategies requiring margin, be sure to contact\nyour broker so you fully understand all of the calculations and account\nrequirements. Then add these costs to your expenses.\n» Taxes: Identify what types of trading will be completed in your different\naccount types. If you do the limited options trading allowed in retirement\naccounts, you’ll defer those taxes. Otherwise, you’ll pay taxes on your profits\nin all nonretirement accounts. You can get the full information on what type of\noptions trading is allowed in retirement accounts from the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) (www.irs.gov).\nIn addition, when establishing certain option positions when you already hold\na position in the underlying, you may trigger a tax event.",

Following\nthese trading plan guidelines should help keep these initial costs to a minimum:\n» Determining the trading allocations: As part of an overall trading plan,\nidentify both your total trading assets and your maximum allocations for\ndifferent assets and strategies. Stock and ETF trading will require larger\nallocations than option positions. You may even want to break down specific\namounts of money you will risk further to include a maximum allocation\namount for new strategies based on paper-trading results.\n» Calculating trade size: You must also determine guidelines for maximum\nposition size prior to entering any trade. After they’re set, identifying the\nmaximum number of contracts you can allocate to a position is pretty\nstraightforward. Divide the option price by an allocation amount below your\nmaximum and you’re all set. Don’t anticipate using the max allocation.\n146 PART 2 Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies",

You may prefer the\nlatter because a fixed dollar amount can be significant with smaller trades or\nif your trading assets decrease. Periodically perform an analysis on your trade\nresults to determine whether your losses remain at reasonable and sustaina-\nble levels. The bottom line should be how much money is left in your account\nand whether it makes sense to continue your current approach.\n» Focusing on entry and exit rules: Option entries are often driven by\ntrending and volatility conditions but may also be time oriented with positions\ncreated prior to specific scheduled events. Option exits can also be time\ndriven (post-event or pre-expiration) or may be triggered by movement in the\nunderlying security.

I discuss a few of these in the sections that\nfollow.\nFast markets\nA security is in a fast market when a very large volume of orders is flowing to the\nmarket and it’s difficult for the market maker or specialist to maintain an orderly\nmarket for the security. Because just about every trade is electronic, this type\nof market has to have an extraordinary component to it. Moreover, the algos amplify\nthis market and it turns into a feeding frenzy. But as rare as it is, it does happen\nlike when the Gamestop (GME) short squeeze hit the Robin Hood brokerage system\nin early 2021. So what’s your best bet? Make sure you trade with a reputable broker\nwho actually has enough cloud space to handle a real trading Armageddon.\nNevertheless, when a fast market does develop volume, quotes and execution\nreports can be delayed and become essentially worthless.

This is yet another reason to be close to\nyour trading station when you have open option orders.\nWhen a stock goes into a fast market, so do the options derived from it.\nIf you place a market order when fast markets are declared, the trade may end up\ngetting executed minutes after the order is placed when the price is significantly\ndifferent. The trade could cost you much more than anticipated.\nIf you must exit a position, you may have no choice but to trade under these con-\nditions, but consider entering a marketable limit order that provides you with a\ncushion, because it’s not uncommon for movements to occur quickly in both\ndirections. And although some of these potential events may seem daunting to\nthose who may not be familiar with higher-risk forms of trading, these are just\nthe chances that you take when you trade. That’s why, over and over in this book,\nI continue to note that no matter what, managing your risk comes first.\nTrader-driven conditions\nConsider your trading platform and connectivity when identifying factors that\nimpact order execution. If the time it takes to get a quote and submit an order is\nlengthy, the delay in obtaining an order execution may be on your end and not the\nbroker’s or exchange’s.

If this is done,\nthe order is considered a booked order. The impact to you is that the depth of the\nmarket at this price may be pretty small — the order may represent just one or\ntwo contracts. Execution quality rules don’t apply to such quotes.\nElectronic review\nThere may be other causes of order delays and strange fills. Your broker may have\nan electronic order review process that delays routing your orders to an exchange.\nThis delay can be several minutes. You may trade actively and never encounter\nsuch a delay or experience such a quick review that order routing appears to be\nseamless.

The\norder platforms and trading screens available currently may also provide you with\na wider variety of approaches to exit an option position.

This is extremely helpful in protecting\nyour downside and establishing exits based on technical levels as well as offering\nanother way to manage risk in volatile markets.\nUnderstanding what to expect in actual trading is pretty important. Sometimes\ndifferent types of orders are appropriate, but without a lot of experience using\nthem, you’re not sure how to proceed. Your broker should always welcome your\ncall (or email) when clarifying exchange rules or proper order entry for their trade\nplatforms. If you’re in a hurry, you can use the chat mode as well.\nDifferent SEC rules in place require brokers to provide execution statistics on dif-\nferent orders. The regulation primarily covers market and marketable limit stock\norders, but also includes some reporting for options.\nManaging risk with single options\nYou can manage risk in a couple different ways when you hold a single option\nposition:\n» You can use a stop order on the option itself (refer to the section, “Identifying\noption stop-order challenges” earlier in this chapter).\n» You can place a conditional or contingent order on the underlying stock.",

The construction\nnames should help. The following examples show what I mean:\n» When a high-priced stock declines in a price-weighted index, it leads to\nbigger moves down in an index compared to declines in a lower-priced\nstock. The Dow is an example of a price-weighted index that is affected more\nby Boeing (trading near $175) than Pfizer (trading near $35).\n» A market-cap-weighted index such as the S&P 500 is impacted more by\nhigher market capitalization stocks regardless of price. For example, at\nthe time of this writing, Alphabet (GOOGL) has a market cap of $1.44 trillion.\nCompare that to Texas Instruments (TXN), a well-known specialty semiconduc-\ntor company. Both are members of the S&P 500. But when Google moves up\nor down in price, it creates a greater change in the S&P 500 than TXN does,\nbecause the latter has a market cap of $178 billion.\n» All the stocks in an equal-dollar-weighted index should have the same\nimpact on the index value. To keep the index balance, a quarterly adjust-\nment of the stocks is required. This prevents a stock that has seen large gains\nduring the last three months from having too much weight on the index.\nThe best way to obtain specific construction information for an index is by access-\ning the website of the company that created the index.",

The amount of cash is determined by the intrinsic value of the option.

The following factors determine the option’s value:\n» Its type (call or put): Calls increase in value as the index increases in price,\nwhereas puts increase in value when the index price falls.\n» The value of the index level relative to the option’s strike price: A call has\nintrinsic value when the strike price is below the index level, which means that\nthe option is in the money (ITM) because the index value has moved above\nthe strike price. When the index is trading below the call strike price, the\noption only has time value. On the other hand, the reverse is true for put\noptions — a put has intrinsic value when the index is trading below the put\nstrike price.\n» Time to expiration: Time passed erodes the value of your option. The more\ntime until expiration, the greater the chance that an option will have value at\nexpiration.

The expected future movement affects an option’s\nvalue in the same way its past movement does — in fact, it’s partially based on\nit. The greater the potential move, the more expensive the option.\nDetailing option components\nThe main components of an index option are basically the same as those for a\nstock option. (See Chapter 2 for more details.) The main difference is that an index\nisn’t a physical asset. As a result, this affects the exercise or assignment process\nbecause settlement is only in terms of cash exchanging hands. Here’s a list of\nindex option components similar to stock options:\n» Underlying: Name of the index the option is based on.\n» Strike price: Level that determines where the owner has rights and the seller\nhas obligations.\n» Premium: Total cost of the option based on the current market price and the\noption multiplier.",

The next section goes over\nsome differences between stock and index options.\nWatching Out for Style Risk\nThis section isn’t about you trading last year’s big fashion fad — it’s about mak-\ning sure that you know options have style. An option’s style primarily refers to the\nway the contract is exercised, and it also impacts the end of trading for the option.\nYou have to know where to look to find an index option’s style and how it\naffects you.\nIf you don’t know the style for a particular option, you can end up with an unpleas-\nant surprise . . . such as missing an opportunity to exercise an index call contract\nbefore it takes a tumble on the settlement value day.\nThe U.S. markets trade two styles for option contracts, which I discuss in the fol-\nlowing sections:\n» American style: American-style options let you exercise your rights at any\npoint up to the exercise cutoff time.\n» European style: If you own European-style options, you can only exercise\nyour rights on a designated date.\nAmerican-style options\nOptions, including all stock and ETF options, that use stock for the deliverable\npackage are American style. Unless stated otherwise, references to American-\nstyle stock options describe the general term option contract in this book. You can\ndetermine an option’s style by checking out its product specification sheet, avail-\nable from the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) or the different option\nexchanges. The OCC website (www.theocc.com) and exchange websites serve as\nexcellent resources for this information.\nCHAPTER 9 Getting to Know Different Option Styles 169",

It’s also worth mentioning that early exercise\nis rarely desirable because it forfeits the option’s time value. When you decide to\nexercise, as a retail trader, you provide exercise instructions to your broker, who\nthen provides these instructions to the OCC. The OCC randomly assigns a broker\nwith accounts holding the same option short, and the broker assigns one of those\naccounts.\nWhen you own an American-style call or put, you have the right to exercise the\ncontract at any point up until your broker’s exercise cutoff time. You exercise the\ncontract by submitting exercise instructions to the broker, either by phone or\nelectronically.\nBe prepared for the unexpected. This point can’t be stressed enough: Don’t assume\nthat you have the same exercise cutoff time as your trading partner, a clearing firm, or\nanyone else. Always check the specific cutoff time and exercise process with your\nbroker. Be sure to leave sufficient time to reach them and provide instructions.\nKnowing the nuts and bolts\nThe best practice before trading any options contract is contacting your broker\nahead of time to check their exercise process; you want this information in advance\nso everything goes smoothly when you actually need to submit instructions.",

That means no securities\nchange hands during exercise or assignment — just cold hard cash. The amount\nof cash for this option is determined by the option moneyness and option\nmultiplier.\nYou calculate European-style option moneyness using the SET as follows:\nIndex – Option Strike Price = Call Moneyness\nOption Strike Price – Index = Put Moneyness\nSo you determine the exercise cash amount this way:\nOption Moneyness × Option Multiplier = Cash Settlement Amount\nWhen moneyness falls below zero, an option has no intrinsic value. In this case,\nno cash would change hands.\nAssuming a SET value of 1523 for SPX and a multiplier of 100, the exercise and\nassignment amount for expiring call and put options with a 1520 strike price is as\nfollows:\n» Call Moneyness: 1523 – 1520 = 3\n» Call Exercise Amount: 3 × 100 = $300 Credit\n» Call Assignment Amount: $300 Debit\n» Put Moneyness: 1520 – 1523 < 0\n» Put Exercise Amount: 0 × 100 = $0 Credit\n» Put Assignment Amount: $0 Debit\nBecause no asset changes hands during this process, your market risk over the\nweekend due to good or bad news is nonexistent.\nSatisfying Option Obligations\nWhen you sell an option short, you have an obligation, not a right.

A perfect example is when a long put is auto-exercised, resulting in an\nunwanted stock position.\nEuropean-style options\nEuropean-style options provide you with an advantage over American-style\noptions if you’re short the option contract.

This may result in OTM puts\nbecoming ITM.\nBreaking It Down: American-Style\nIndex Options\nOne of the most popular American-style index options is the S&P 100 Index (OEX)\ncontract. You can exercise your rights anytime you own a long contract or be\nassigned whenever you hold a short contract. American-style index options settle\nin cash because an index can’t be bought or sold.\nBecause these contracts can be exercised any time, you have to know how the set-\ntlement value is determined prior to expiration.

You should consider time value when\ndeciding whether to sell the index option in the market or exercise your contract\nrights.

The bottom line: The options markets of the early\n2000s are no longer an adequate benchmark to describe what goes on in the pres-\nent and what’s likely to happen in the future. Of course, that may sound scary, but\nhistory shows that every similar seismic change in the past has led to a new set of\nchallenges as well as significant opportunities.\nHowever, don’t get discouraged. Options are the perfect trading vehicle for uncer-\ntain times because they offer protection for both portfolios and trading positions.\nBecause a variety of strategies are available to you, you have the opportunity to\nprepare by putting in place ahead of events — no matter what the situation calls\nfor.

With ten days to go until expiration, $0.0216 is 4.8 percent of the\ncontract’s $0.45 value.\nThe way you go about protecting positions is similar to any other investment\ndecision — it depends on your risk tolerance and personal preferences. Find an\napproach that suits your style.

Losses are now capped.\nWeighing protection cost versus time\nWhen you have a specific, reasonably short time horizon to protect a position,\nselecting the expiration month is pretty straightforward. After you seek longer-term\nprotection, the analysis requires a bit more effort. Because you expect the security to\nmove upward on a longer-term basis, at-the-money (ATM) options should be OTM\nby expiration and may be minimally effective in protecting the stock’s appreciated\nvalue since purchase. You can consider buying a series of short-term puts instead,\nbecause doing so allows for the adjustment of put strikes along the way. The down-\nside to multiple puts is that they cost more. So, before making any trades, you should\nweigh the cost of protection against the amount of time the protection is in place.\nCHAPTER 10 Protecting Your Portfolio with Options 191",

Without risk\nthere is no reward, but it doesn’t mean you have to risk it all. Consider protective\npositions as a means of limiting your losses while letting your profits run.\nLong-term protection\nIn options trading, nothing substitutes doing your homework and thinking things\nthrough. Suppose you noted that stock XYZ has consistently realized annual gains\nof 8 percent, even during years with a 2 percent decline along the way. How do you\ngo about protecting such a position? A $2.15 ATM put that provided five months of\nprotection was used in the XYZ example. Since XYZ was at 37.50, the put premium\nrepresents 5.7 percent of its value. That could cost you a fair amount of your pro-\njected return, assuming XYZ and XYZ behave similarly.\nBalancing the cost of protection versus returns is difficult and requires a game\nplan. Again, it’s not a one-size-fits-all proposition. If you buy puts on a regular\nbasis, you could be sacrificing stock returns and then some. On the other hand,\nignoring protection completely could cost you a big chunk of your initial investment.\nThe short answer to this problem: Find the balance right for you. You may decide\nto intermittently use puts when bearish periods arise, but if you could time the\nmarkets that well, you probably wouldn’t need protection. The flipside is that you\ncan factor in how much of a potential reduction to your gains could come from\nbuying puts on a regular basis and adjust your expectations accordingly.\nThink in terms of the value of the entire position — the stock and the put — and\nthe effect of changes in price to the whole amount. When purchasing puts to pro-\ntect your investments, be sure to balance the cost of protection versus net returns\nfor the protective put position.\n192 PART 3 What Every Trader Needs to Know about Options",

To make this calculation, divide the option premium by\nthe number of days to expiration:\n» XYZ Oct 37.50 Put @ $1.05 = $1.05 × 100 = $105\n» $105 ÷ 60 days = $1.75 Per Day\n» XYZ Jan 37.50 Put @ $2.15 = $2.15 × 100 = $215\n» $215 ÷ 150 Days = $1.43 Per Day\nThe XYZ Jan 37.50 put transaction translates to a cost of approximately $0.0143\nper share for the option if held to expiration.\nBe careful of letting your emotions run away with you.

You can estimate the hedge by starting with the current\nindex level (1040) and subtracting the decline you’re willing to accept to obtain a\nstarting point for strike price selection, as follows:\n» 1040 – (1040 × 0.02) = 20.8\n» 1040 – 20.8 = 1019.20\nBoth the 1040 and 1050 strike prices can be considered. Using the 1040 put option:\n» Protection Provided by 1 Put: 1 × 1040 × 100 = $104,000\n» Protection Provided by 2 Puts: 2 × 1040 × 100 = $208,000\n» Portfolio Protected: $208,000 ÷ $225,000 = 92.44%\nIf the OEX drops below 1040, your puts gain intrinsic value at a pace equal to the\nput’s delta. The further the OEX declines, the closer the puts get to a 1:1 move with\nthe index. As soon as the put option is ITM, it will gain intrinsic value 1 for 1 with\nthe index. The time remaining until expiration will also affect the actual gains\nmade by the hedge.\nCHAPTER 10 Protecting Your Portfolio with Options 199",

The amount the put option holder receives is also called\nthe option package exercise value.

The next example\ngoes into this in more detail.\nATM calls generally have deltas that are slightly greater than 0.50, whereas ATM\nputs are generally slightly less than 0.50. Using 0.50 as an approximation is usu-\nally fine for the initial strategy evaluation.\nAlgos and other big money traders often use index options and options on index\nfutures to hedge their trades. As a result, especially near expiration, the volatility\nin these options and the resulting underlying indexes, as well as related options\nsuch as those based on ETFs linked to indexes, can be extreme.\nStock hedge\nStarting with a perfect stock hedge using XYZ, assume you have allocated approx-\nimately $5,000 to a combined position (stock plus put). Because XYZ is trading at\n$37.50, you anticipate owning about 100 shares. Using the XYZ option data from\nTable 10-1, you focus on the Jan 35 strike price option with five months to expira-\ntion. The put has a delta of –29.1. Because three puts (see the preceding example\nto figure out how many puts you need to cover the full risk of 100 shares) won’t\nquite hedge 100 shares of stock, you evaluate a potential position using four puts.\nThe delta for four Jan 35 puts is like this:\nPosition Delta = # of Contracts × Delta = 4 × (–29.1) = –116.4\nGiven that 1 share of stock has +1 delta, a long position of 100 shares represents\n+100 deltas. A perfectly hedged position has a combined delta equal to zero, so\n116 shares of XYZ are required. You calculate the position delta as follows:\n» 116 Shares × +1 Delta Per Share = +116 Deltas\n» 4 Puts × –29.1 Delta Per Put = –116.4 Deltas\n» Position Delta = +116 + (–116.4) = –0.4 Deltas\nThe cost of the position is the following:\n» 116 Shares × $37.50 = $4,350\n» 4 Puts × $1.35 × 100 = $540\n» Position Cost = $4,350 + 540 = $4,890\nCHAPTER 10 Protecting Your Portfolio with Options 201",

Every time XYZ moves up\nor down $1, delta changes approximately by its gamma value. The chapters in\nPart 4 offer ways to profit from this changing situation as prices fluctuate.\nRecall that the delta for an option changes by gamma for each $1 change in the\nunderlying stock. Because of this, options are referred to as a variable delta secu-\nrity. The delta for one share of stock, on the other hand, stays constant. One long\nshare of stock will also represent +1 delta, so it’s referred to as a fixed delta secu-\nrity. Thus, the easy way to remember these relationships is that delta is the mid-\ndleman between the price of the underlying and the value of gamma. You can\nexpect the value of your option to be affected by the value of delta per $1 change\nin the underlying. Delta, in turn, will change by the value of gamma, which also\nresponds to the changing price of the underlying.\nPortfolio hedge\nHedging a portfolio is a bit more inexact than hedging an individual position, but\nyou approach a perfect portfolio hedge similarly.

Using an index level of 1040, the\nMar 1050 puts are ITM by 10 points. The market price for these puts is $210.50,\nwith an assumed delta of –0.549 for this example. Your goal is to get closer to\n1:1 protection, so purchasing two Mar 1050 puts results in the following:\n» 2 × 1050 × 100 = $210,000\n» 2 × –0.0.549 = –01.10\nIn this case, for each 1-point decline in the OEX, the value of the combined puts\nincreases by 1.10. For a short period of time, this results in 1.1 times the protection\nof a $225,000 portfolio. Multiplying $210,000 by 1.1 yields protection for a portfo-\nlio valued at $231,000. Given the variable nature of an option’s delta, you’ll likely\nbe satisfied with portfolio protection that is a little less exact.

As a result, if losses become significant, you have to\nnot just cover the losses but pay back the loan.\nMoreover, when leverage is part of a trade, the direction of prices, both up and\ndown, is more than when you trade without leverage. Thus, when leverage is used\nirresponsibly as some hedge funds and the inexperienced often do, things can\nturn out badly because losses can be exaggerated.\nTraditionally, when you think of leveraging assets, you think of increasing your\nrisk — at least on the stock-trading side. But as you rewire your brain, consider\nthe fact that options are unique because they allow you to leverage your assets\nwith less money. What that means is that your gains outpace stock gains in per-\ncentage terms, whereas your losses are limited as long as you craft your strategy\ncorrectly. And that’s a nice combination — less capital at risk, less money spent,\nand more upside potential in one package.

So why not do it for less?\nIf you spend $100 on a call option for a $100 stock in which you own 100 shares,\nby owning the option you’re participating in the price of the stock for less. So if\nthe stock goes up $1, you made $100 on a $10,000 investment. Meanwhile, if the\noption goes up $0.50, you make $50, which is a 50 percent profit on the option\nwith much less risk. If the stock goes down $5, you lose $500 whereas with the\noption, the worst loss would be $100.\nBe careful when using leverage. When used responsibly, especially via the use of\noptions and well-designed option strategies, leverage offers you the ability to\nmanage your risk and maximize your profits, as the following sections discuss.\nDetermining your total dollars at risk\nThe take-home message is that options reduce risk because you invest less money\non any individual trade.

For example, the Alphabet\n(GOOGL) January 15, 2022 430 call symbol is GOOGL22A15430.0. The symbol is\nfollowed by the 16A15 nomenclature signifying the January 2022 expiration.

Although all these things are also required for stock trading, the\ndifference is you can hold on to long stock position for months as it trades side-\nways.

You can be correct about the direction and timing of a stock move and\nstill have the magnitude be too small to make your option position profitable. This\nhappens to all option traders.\nHow can you minimize these shortfalls? For the most part, having some tools —\ntechnical or fundamental — that provide estimated price projections can help.\nFurthermore, staying vigilant and paying attention to what the market is doing\nand what your position is doing in relation to the market is important.

Consider taking a portion of your profits off the table by exiting\npart of your total position when the move you anticipated is partially complete.\nOption pricing models also help you identify higher probability trades by provid-\ning you with\n» Expected movement implied by the option price (implied volatility).\n» An estimate of the probability the option will be ITM at expiration.\nBy using these option components in your trade analysis, you can determine\nwhether the option price is relatively expensive or inexpensive given the stock’s\nhistory, past option pricing, and market conditions. Generally speaking, the\nhigher the value of IV compared to that of HV signals the expense of the option.\nFor example if IV for XYZ call option is 65 and HV is 25, the option can be consid-\nered expensive.

Ideally, though, this isn’t the\nonly guideline you use to exit a position.\nThere are no one-size-fits-all criteria for selecting expiration periods, because\nthey can vary by strategy and your trading style. The most straightforward time\nhorizon for option trading is associated with scheduled releases of news or reports\nthat can prompt strong movement by a specific date. These include\n» Economic or industry reports such as unemployment figures or semicon-\nductor orders\n» Earnings releases\nSome technical tools also provide estimated time projections, including price pat-\nterns or cycles.

This is also accomplished when a call option is added to a\nshort stock position. In both cases, the position cost increases.\nThe breakeven level for a stock is simply the entry price. Because option premi-\nums represent a cost to you above and beyond your strike price contract rights, a\nbreakeven value must be calculated using both the strike price and option price.\nWhen creating positions that are focused on specific market outlooks, you can\ncombine the following:\n» Call and/or put options with stocks\n» Different call options together\n» Different put options together\n» Calls and puts together\nAdding long puts or calls to stock are the only combined positions discussed so\nfar, but short options can also be used to reduce risk, by\n» Further reducing the net cost of the position\n» Increasing the potential directions the underlying can trade while still realizing\nprofits\nWhen a short option is properly combined with the underlying stock or a long\noption of the same type, it’s said to be covered. That’s because your risk (obliga-\ntions) under the short contract can be satisfied using the stock or by exercising\nyour rights under the long contract. Without such protection, the short contract is\nreferred to as naked. That’s kind of a good visual on your exposure and risk of\ninjury in nasty places such as the market.\nTrading naked options allows you to receive a credit when you open a position —\nthis credit is equal to the option premium. If all goes well, the option expires\nout-of-the-money (OTM), and you get to keep the credit. Different newsletters\npromote naked option strategies, and this may seem like a great way to bring in\nmonthly revenue — but seller beware.\nGoing naked with a short call option is the riskiest position you can create, and I\nstrongly advise against such a trade. Rather than creating a limited risk, unlimited\nreward consistent with good risk management, a naked short call is an unlimited-\nrisk, limited-reward position.\n216 PART 3 What Every Trader Needs to Know about Options",

The next sections introduce spread trades, which are limited-risk,\nlimited-reward combination positions.\nSpreading the risk with a debit trade\nA vertical spread is a position that combines two options, one long and one short\noption of the same type (calls or puts), having the same expiration month and\ndifferent strike prices.\nIt’s referred to as vertical because that’s how the strike prices line up when you\nlook at an option chain. It’s called a spread because it spreads the risk by using two\npositions based on the same stock. You can create a vertical spread for an initial\ndebit or an initial credit. In each case, the position has limited risk and limited\nreward. Each option position in a vertical spread is referred to as a leg.\nThe type of vertical spread selected depends on your market outlook.

And because you\ndon’t get something for nothing on Wall Street, reducing your risk this way comes\nat a price in the form of reduced rewards.\nFor example, if ABC is trading at 37.65 and you’re bullish on the stock, you can\ncreate a bull call spread by completing both the following transactions:\n» Buy 1 Jan 35 Call @ $4.20.\n» Sell 1 Jan 40 Call @ $1.50.\nThe debit for the bull call spread position is $270 ([$4.20 – 1.50] × 100). This is\nalso the maximum risk and occurs when ABC closes at $35 or less at expiration. At\nthis price, both calls will be worthless.\nUnlike a basic long call, your maximum reward is limited for a bull call spread\nbecause the short obligation prevents you from realizing unlimited rewards.",

This means that when they make a market for your long call order and end up\nwith a short call position, they’ll usually buy shares of stock or other long calls to cover\nthis new short position.\nWhen you enter an order for a vertical spread for a debit, the trader can execute your\norder without having to worry about hedging the position. They basically just create a\nvertical spread for a credit.\nVertical spread orders are appealing to floor traders because when they execute the\ntrade, they don’t have to do anything else. They’re already hedged. That’s why you can\nusually get a vertical spread order executed below the debit quoted in the market.\nWhen you place an order for a new vertical debit spread, consider using a limit\namount that is less than the quoted price for the combined position to reduce the\nimpact of slippage. You probably won’t be able to execute the trade at the mid-\npoint of the spread, but you likely can get the order filled if you shave a little off\nthe debit amount.\nJim Fink’s Velocity Trader newsletter (www.investingdaily.com) is all about\nspreads and is worth looking into if you find this type of trading appealing.\nSpreading the risk with a credit trade\nDebit spreads aren’t the only type of spread trade you can create using calls or\nputs.",

This strategy is known as a collar.\nBut there is more to it than just collars. In fact, covered option strategies with\nstock are only the beginning. This strategy can be implemented without stock by\nusing options and varying the different components of a vertical spread. By using\nthe same strike price in a vertical spread while varying the expiration month for\nthe two options, you create a calendar spread, which adds time flexibility to the\nposition. By allowing the strike prices to also change, you create a diagonal spread\nthat provides even more flexibility for almost any short-term to long-term\noutlook.\nCHAPTER 12 Combination Strategies: Spreads and Other Wild Things 229",

You can sell calls when holding a long stock position\nto reduce the cost of the position and bring in some incremental income. Simi-\nlarly, a short put can be sold against short stock to boost the returns.

And as with any other new\nstrategy the best way to get started is to do some paper trading. To review paper\ntrading and its benefits, check out Chapter 7.\nMoreover, start out with the simplest of strategies, such as the following ones,\nbefore moving on to more complex strategies such as spreads.\nCreating covered positions\nA covered position includes a short option with an obligation that you satisfy with\nstock or a long option of the same type for the same underlying.",

Because a credit is brought into your account when you sell the call, you\nalso reduce the risk of the long stock position. But although you gain income,\nthere is a significant downside for you, because you’re capping potential gains in\nyour stock position. This will happen if the market price of the stock moves up,\nrising above the strike price of the call. Then you’ll be obligated to sell the stock at\nthe lower strike price if you get assigned.\nAn optimal time to sell calls is usually within 30–45 days to expiration, so choose\nwisely when implementing this strategy. If for any reason you need to hold onto a\nstock position (because of capital gains or similar reasons), don’t sell calls against\nit.

Algos use this technique to hedge their portfolios. Because a credit\nis brought into your account when you sell the put, you also reduce the cost basis\nof the short stock position, resulting in slightly reduced risk for the position. The\ndownside is that you’re capping potential gains.\nBut why cap your gains this way? Capitalizing on a bearish outlook with a long put\nor bear put spread makes more sense.\nThe short put position is an obligation, not a right. You’re at the mercy of the\nmarket and circumstances because you can’t elect to have the stock put to you to\noffset the short stock position. The put doesn’t serve as protection — you’d need\nto buy a call to change the position risk from unlimited to limited.\nTraders tend to sell puts when the market is rising aggressively in hopes that the\nmarket will continue to rise and that the put against them won’t be exercised. Mar-\nket makers know this and hedge by buying puts to offset the risk. If you use this\nstrategy at a time when the market is about to roll over, your losses could be large,\nespecially if you sold naked puts.

Covering a short call obligation and protect-\ning a long stock position aren’t the same thing. Although the covered call strategy\nis considered a relatively conservative approach to investing, it actually leaves you\nexposed to risk that is very similar to long stock. Another way you can manage\nstock risk for less money than a protective put strategy (see Chapter 10) is by cre-\nating a collar on the stock by combining the following:\n» Implementing a long stock position\n» Buying a protective put on the underlying stock\n» Selling a call on the underlying stock\nBy selling a call in combination with a protected stock position, you reduce the\ncost of that protection. Your only obligation is from the short call because the put\nrepresents a right. The short call remains covered by the stock.\nA short option represents an obligation that is only considered covered if the\nassociated stock or long options have no other obligations or requirements.\nAside from covered calls, one of my other favorite options strategies is the collar.\nThat’s because, as I discuss in detail in the next section, when used properly, it\nlimits event-related risk, such as what can happen during an earnings report.\nDefining a collar\nYou create a collar by purchasing a put and selling a call for a new or existing stock\nposition. It’s a limited-risk, limited-reward position that\n» Significantly reduces long stock and covered call risk from limited, but high to\nsimply limited\n» Significantly reduces long stock rewards from unlimited to limited\nKeeping the differences in these two types of positions straight is important.\nA covered call strategy may be considered a short-term trade or income generator,\nwhereas a collared position is considered a protected position. Thus, the collar\noffers two different risk-management dynamics that together work better if your\ngoal is maximizing your protection. The main goal of the short call is to reduce the\ncost of protection. Doing so slightly reduces the risk of a protected put position.\nCHAPTER 12 Combination Strategies: Spreads and Other Wild Things 235",

Doing so slightly reduces the risk of a protected put position.\nCHAPTER 12 Combination Strategies: Spreads and Other Wild Things 235\n\n[Page 250]\nAfter you sell a call short, you’re obligated to sell the underlying stock when\nassigned. Don’t create a collar around a position unless you’re willing and able to\npart with the underlying stock.\nCollaring long stock\nA collar is a hedged position that has limited risk and limited reward. Your risk is\nlimited to the downside by the put strike price, and your reward is limited to the\nupside by the call strike price. If the stock goes below the strike price, you don’t\nnecessarily need to exercise the put. You can decide to sell the put for a profit\ninstead.\nThe long put and short call strike prices create a cap on long stock risks and\nrewards, respectively. The two option positions in combination provide a collar\naround the stock price.\nCollars are useful in specific situations and are best used to protect gains. Most\ncollars are short-term positions initiated late in the calendar year and then\nremoved at the beginning of the following year so that the stock can be sold and\nthe tax won’t be due until the year after.\nThe term peg is used to describe the cap a short call creates on long stock appre-\nciation. You may see this applied to the short call position when reviewing account\nbalances.\nProfiling collar risks\nThe risk associated with a collar strategy is significantly less than long stock. The\nlong put caps the risk while increasing the position’s cost. This cost is slightly\noffset by the credit received when selling the call.\nSuppose you own 100 shares of ABC at $37.86, and you’re bearish on it over the\nnext 11⁄2 months. You want to protect your position but don’t want to spend a lot\nof money to do it. You decide to create a collar around ABC using next month\noptions, which expire in 45 days.\nBefore buying a 37.50 strike put option for $1.20 and selling the 40 strike call\noption at $0.70, you complete the following key calculations:\nNet Debit = (1.20 – 0.70) × 100) = $50\nMax Risk = [(Stock Purchase Price – Put Strike Price) × 100] + Net Debit =\n[($37.86 – 37.50) × 100] + 50 = $86\n236 PART 3 What Every Trader Needs to Know about Options",

Yes, an ETF is a different animal\nfrom a mutual fund, but it’s still a security that in most cases is made up of dif-\nferent component stocks, bonds, and/or commodities and is typically designed to\ntrack a specific index or segment of the market.

Thus, a good way to understand them is by comparing them to\nmarket indexes. The two types have many similarities, but one important differ-\nence makes ETFs very powerful: You can own an ETF. And that means you expand\nthe option strategies available to you.\nGenerally speaking, because ETFs track a group of securities, ETF volatility can be\nless than that of its component stocks, bonds, or commodities. That’s because a\nstrong decline in one security in the group may be offset by less severe declines or\ngains in the other components.",

Most ETFs actually track a specific index\n(see Chapter 9 for more on indexes).\nOne of the best characteristics ETFs and indexes share is they both have options\navailable for trading.

This is especially important if an ETF is a limited partnership\n(LP) because these instruments can make tax preparation and management diffi-\ncult at times.\nConnecting the common ground\nClearly a measure (index) and a security (ETF) are different beasts, but for now\nconsider the similarities. ETFs share the following characteristics with indexes:\n» Available for a variety of asset classes, sectors, and regions\n» Impacted by the index construction weighting method\n» Offered by a variety of financial service firms\n» Similarly affected by the influence of the options markets on underlying stock\nprices\n» Tend to rise and fall in price in similar fashion to underlying index\nOne thing is for sure: If you’re looking for a segment of the market to invest or\ntrade, more than likely an ETF will fit the bill for you.\nLooking at weight management for ETFs\nETF managers use weightings similar to the index-weighting method to achieve\nsimilar returns.\nThe weighting method used for index construction determines the impact a compo-\nnent security has on the index value. Although an ETF won’t always track an index\nexactly, the weighting method affects ETF value changes given component changes.\nHere’s what you want to remember about construction methods for stock indexes:\n» A market-capitalization weighted index is impacted more by higher-\ncapitalization stocks.\nCHAPTER 13 Understanding ETFs, Options, and Other Useful Tricks 247",

Be sure spreads don’t\nsignificantly impact your slippage costs.\n» Impact of dividends: Certain groups of stocks provide higher dividend\npayouts.

It’s also a measure of whether an option is cheap\nor expensive. Indeed, the bigger the price swings in an ETF, the bigger the poten-\ntial risk, because declines can occur rapidly as well. Therefore, you may decide to\naccept this high potential risk because price swings go both ways — gains can\naccumulate quickly too.\nWhen buying options, you pay more for those based on an underlying security that\nis more volatile because its past movement (measured by HV) is a major component\nin the option’s IV. Make sure you understand that IV is part of the time-value por-\ntion of an option — the portion that decays each day as you get closer to expiration.\nIn other words, high IV options will have greater price declines as expirations near\nwhich is why I recommend you sell them with 45 days or less to expiration.\nThe fact that this risk measure increases an option’s cost makes it that much more\ncritical for you to understand both volatility measures (HV and IV). It’s not just about\nincreased risk and reward — it’s about how much you’ll be paying for this risk.\nBuy options with low IV in comparison to HV (inexpensive) and sell options with\nhigh IV in comparison to HV (expensive).\nFigures 13-3 (ETF daily price) and 13-4 (option price and IV) illustrate this relation-\nship.",

Some less-than-scientific ways to identify whether you’re risking\nmore than might be prudent is by gauging how you sleep at night or your irritabil-\nity levels during market declines. These measures, although subjective, do matter\nand should become part of how you evaluate your trading plan.

In order to survive as a trader, the number-\none rule is managing your risk.\nThe upside is that options are the best risk-management tools in the financial\nmarkets.

Doing so is certainly possible and the two strate-\ngies discussed in this section rely on increasing volatility, not price direction. In\naddition, anticipating this type of activity is more straightforward than anticipat-\ning direction because volatility changes often occur when scheduled reports and\nother news items are released.\nAnticipating a change in volatility for a stock is generally easier than anticipating\na change in price.\nHere are two basic strategies that allow you to profit under such conditions:\n» A straddle\n» A strangle\nBoth of these positions combine a long call and a long put. The strategy works best\nwhen the stock delivers a move that is enough to have the call or put realize gains\nthat cover the cost of both options with some profits to spare. This usually requires\nthe losing option price to drop to near zero while the winning side soars.\nCapitalizing on a big move — A straddle\nA straddle is a combination position you create by purchasing both a call and put\nfor the same underlying stock. You use the strategy when you expect a big move\nto occur in the stock, but you’re not sure of the direction. You construct a straddle\nusing the following:\n» A long call and long put\n» The same expiration month\n» The same strike price\nThe reason the basic form of this strategy requires a large directional move is\nbecause all the profits are expected to result from one leg of the position while the\nother leg expires close to worthless. In practice, you can turn a profit with this\nstrategy in several ways, even with moderate moves.\n276 PART 4 Advanced Strategies for Options Traders",

That’s because if the move doesn’t\nmaterialize, traders will unload both calls and puts in a hurry and both sides of the\ntrade will lose value rapidly. At the same time, using straddles helps you trade\nwith the odds because rather than betting on one direction, the stock can move in\ntwo possible directions.\nFor a straddle to be profitable, the stock doesn’t actually have to move above or\nbelow the position breakevens. At times a smaller move is profitable because the\nout-of-money (OTM) option will probably not decrease as quickly as the in-\nthe-money (ITM) option increases.

Make sure you remember that delta-neutral trad-\ning isn’t the “holy grail” for option approaches. You still need to consider the\nposition’s risk profile to see whether the trade has a reasonable risk-reward ratio\nand is one that fits your risk tolerance and financial situation. Moreover, stocks\nthat are trading sideways can continue to do so for extended periods, so nothing\nguarantees the position will yield profits.\nDelta-neutral trading doesn’t guarantee profits or give you an excuse to be sloppy.\nYou still must evaluate potential risks and rewards for a position and identify rea-\nsonable positions sizes and exits to minimize losses.\nTherefore, in order to improve the odds of winning trades, when designing a\ndelta-neutral strategy, paying attention to detail is crucial, and the following sec-\ntions give you a head start.\nIdentifying neutral positions\nChapter 10 introduces neutral approaches with hedged positions. By using puts for\nthe underlying stock, you protect a position because a move down in the stock\nprice results in a move up in the put’s price. When this movement is one to one —\nthat is, the put goes up $1 for every $1 decline in the stock — the stock is said to\nbe perfectly hedged. This occurs when the put is deep ITM and has a delta of –1.0.\nThe combined position behaves neutrally to price changes.\nThe relationship between stock and put movement can vary depending on the\nput(s) used for the strategy.",

So, what may initially be a perfect hedge\ncan turn into a partial hedge for a long option that becomes OTM or an excessive\nhedge for long options that become ITM. The expected change in delta is meas-\nured using gamma and varies, depending on the moneyness of the option and how\nclose you are to expiration.\nIn addition, the stock-put position isn’t the only one available to you for hedging\npurposes. By combining other stock and options, or just options, you can achieve\nperfectly and partially hedged positions that are neutral.\nDelta-neutral trading is more geared toward longer time frames (on the higher\nend of 30 to 90 days).

You calculate the posi-\ntion delta by adding the deltas for all the individual legs.\nSuppose you held a protective put position with two puts and 100 shares of long\nstock. If each put has a delta of –45 (net –90), you calculate the delta for the com-\nbined position as follows:\n(Shares of Stock × Stock Delta) + (Contracts × Option Delta)\nTogether, the puts move up $0.90 for every $1 decline in the stock. This is a partial\nhedge with a minor loss in the position when the stock goes down. Your position\ngains modestly when the stock goes up. As a result, it has a slight directional bias\nto the upside.\nYou can use delta values to identify the directional bias for a position. Combined\ndelta values that are less than 0 have a downward directional bias, whereas those\nwith deltas greater than 100 have an upward bias. The bias indicates the direction\nfor the underlying to move for the position to realize gains.\nHere is a real-life example of how this strategy can pay off: In May 2016, while\nwriting for www.investingdaily.com, I recommended buying shares of McKesson\n(NYSE: MCK), the leading healthcare wholesaler at $180. The stock rallied initially\nbut started to look top-heavy over the next few weeks. On September 19, with the\nstock trading at $166, I recommended buying the November 18 160 put option. The\ndelta at that time was around 0.32 with nearly 60 days to expiration and earnings\ndue out on October 27. The initial trade for 100 shares of MCK was $18,000.",

Hence, the call option has a\n50 percent chance of being ITM.\nA problem arises after the stock actually moves up and the option price changes.\nUsing an options calculator, again you’ll find delta has gone up.

A 10 percent increase in vola-\ntility doesn’t cause a call option with a +0.80 delta to jump to +0.50.\nAssessing gamma changes on delta\nUnderstanding changes in delta also means understanding the option Greek\ngamma. Gamma is greatest for ATM options and then decreases after the option\nbecomes more ITM or OTM. As a result, you’ll find the biggest moves in delta\noccur for your ATM options.\nGamma is greatest for ATM options, so delta changes the most when holding an\nATM option.\nLike delta, gamma is a moving target, but on a smaller scale. Here are some gen-\neral characteristics you should note about gamma:\n» Gamma is always positive.\n» Gamma is highest for ATM options.\n» Gamma increases as you approach expiration.\nBecause gamma is always positive, when the price of a stock goes up $1, a call’s\ndelta increases by gamma. The put delta also increases, but this translates to a\nreduction in the magnitude of the put’s delta because a put delta is negative.\nCreating a delta-neutral straddle\nAs I mention in the section, “Capitalizing on a big move — a straddle,” earlier in\nthis chapter, creating a straddle allows you to realize gains whether a stock moves\nstrongly up or down. Sometimes it’s not even necessary for the move to be that\nbig — the stock just has to keep moving. You establish a straddle position by pur-\nchasing a long call and a long put with the same expiration month and strike\nprice. That strike is either at or near the money, so paying attention to gamma and\ndelta when initiating a neutral position is important.\nThe changing nature of both option pricing factors also makes it necessary to\nmonitor delta and gamma throughout the position’s life and adjust the position as\nprices change.

The bottom line is that returning to delta neutrality may mean adding\nto the position or taking profits off the table.\nBe thorough in your pre-trade analysis and planning. When purchasing at- or\nnear-the-money straddles, you’re predominantly purchasing time value. You\nmust manage your risk by minimizing the effect of accelerating time decay on\nsuch a position by closing it at least 30 days prior to expiration.\nChecking delta status\nReferencing the GS straddle example in the section, “Benefiting from a big move,”\nearlier in this chapter, you obtain the initial position delta by using the options\ncalculator from Optionetics Platinum or another similar premium trading system\nthat offers high-end technical analysis and option tools:\nGS Oct 180 Call Trading at $9.40: (Call Delta = +51.191)\nGS Oct 180 Put Trading at $10.70: (Put Delta = –48.688)\nPosition Delta: [(2 × +51.191) + (2 × -48.688)] = +102.382 – 97.376 = +5.006\nThus this position was similar to one that was long five shares of stock.\nWhat about a few days into the position?

Factors that impact your deci-\nsions include the following:\n» Time to expiration and whether the adjustment buys or sells time value\n» Relative IV levels\n» Trading costs\nA quick comment on the last item: Straddle positions can be hedged with stock,\nwhich may be a more cost-effective approach when making adjustments to the\nposition.

And in the following sections I show\nyou how to let IV become your best trading friend.\nIt’s all relative but not overly scientific\nYou don’t have to be an Einstein to use volatility to your advantage. You just have\nto develop a working knowledge of how to use it. When analyzing an options\ntrade, consider these two types of volatility:\n» HV for the underlying security\n» IV for the option\nBecause you’re paying for IV, focusing on this measure is pretty critical. But that\ndoesn’t mean you can ignore historical volatility — far from it. HV gives you a\nstarting point, allowing you to take the first step in determining whether IV is\nreasonable. Still, IV is the best of the two. And if HV and IV have a discrepancy\nbetween them, trust IV. Nevertheless, because the difference or similarity in read-\nings between the two will guide whether you buy or sell an option, it’s a good\npractice when gauging an option’s IV level to look at both types of volatility.\nAn option’s intrinsic value is its moneyness factor. For a call option, intrinsic value\nis the stock price above the call strike price, and for a put option, it’s the stock\nprice below the put strike price. Intrinsic value is set to zero for any options that\nare out of the money.\n296 PART 4 Advanced Strategies for Options Traders",

HV provides you with information about past\nstock movement. HV can be calculated using any number of trading days, but the\nmeasure itself gives you information about annual movement. The data is extrap-\nolated, which means what happens during the shorter term is extended to a one-\nyear period using statistical techniques.\nHV periods include 6-day, 10-day, 20-day, and 100-day periods. But you have to\nconsider some key components when analyzing this key metric. That’s because\nthe movement that occurs during any period measured varies, depending on\nwhat’s happening in the markets and for the security at that time. Although an\nannualized measure that is created using 10 trading days can suggest much more\nvolatility than one using 100 trading days, much really depends on events taking\nplace over the 10 and 100 trading days during which the measurement took place.\nFor example, if you’re trading options in the summertime, especially in the dog\ndays of August and Wall Street is vacationing in the Hamptons, the 10-day mea-\nsure may understate volatility.\nThe best way for you to get a good feel for past volatility in a stock is by viewing\nHV charts. Charts quickly provide you with a visual on HV conditions and can filter\nout the relativity, or the “when” factor of the whole dynamic.\nExtrinsic value is the time-value component of an option price. It’s what is left over\nafter intrinsic value is determined. Figure 15-1 displays a 12-month HV chart for\nAkamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM), a computer services company. The chart\nincludes 6-day, 10-day, 20-day, and 100-day HV measures.\nFIGURE 15-1:\nTwelve-month\nhistorical volatility\nchart for AKAM.\nImage by Optionetics\nCHAPTER 15 Letting Volatility Show You the Way to Trading Opportunities 297",

In this chart, you can see that the\nsix-day measure (69.90 percent) reflects increased volatility during the last few\ndays. The 10-day (53.99 percent) and 20-day (52.32 percent) measures include\nthis recent volatility, along with quieter trading days, which bring down their\nrespective values.\nIt appears these “quieter” periods may be less typical for the stock, given a\n100-day HV at 61.90 percent. This 100-day measure is telling you that if the stock\nmoves similarly to the last 100 trading days in the next 252 trading days, its\nvolatility for that period will be 61.90 percent.\nNote the different spikes in volatility, which has recently reached two-year highs.\nExpect options for this stock to have IV levels that incorporate these HV spikes in\nits value.\nNot all HV levels mean the same thing.

A look at the S&P 500 during the March\n2007 period showed that the market was starting to stumble. The first price gap coin-\ncided with a market decline that occurred in late February on concerns that a stock\nmarket bubble was bursting in China. Price recovered a bit and then gapped down in\nlate July, possibly in sympathy with a declining U.S. market dealing with sub-prime\nmortgage problems. It’s also important to note that the market recovered after the\nspring swoon, while shares of AKAM continued to lag, highlighting the fact that the\ntype of strategy that may suit shares of AKAM may differ from those that work for\nstocks more in tune with the market. More detective work was clearly required.\nWhen an ATM IV figure reflects a range of days, the value is a composite of call-\nand-put IV values expiring in that time period.\nWas AKAM just a victim of a turbulent market or was something else going on?\nAfter checking headlines for AKAM, the following was apparent:\n» In late February, AKAM hosted a conference call and raised 2007 earnings\nexpectations.

They’re generally created for a net credit by selling more\ncontracts than you buy. Unlike limited-risk vertical spreads, the extra short\ncontract(s) in a ratio spread create risk that is either unlimited (call ratio spread)\nor limited, but high (put ratio spread). Given the high-to-unlimited risk for a\nratio spread, you must know and execute your exit point for a loss prior to estab-\nlishing a ratio spread. In this case, more than in most, trade management is criti-\ncal to risk-management execution.\nAs part of the risk-reward tradeoff, the maximum gain possible when creating a\ncall ratio spread can actually exceed the initial credit you receive when establish-\ning the position. Ratio backspreads, covered in the next section, are limited-risk\nalternatives to ratio spreads.\nRatio spreads have an uneven amount of short and long options of the same type,\nwith the number of short options exceeding the number of long options. As a\nresult, the position incorporates naked options and has either unlimited risk (call\nratio spreads) or limited but high risk (put ratio spread).\nReviewing ratio spread risk profiles\nAs you might expect, you can create two types of ratio spreads — one for each\noption type. So ratio spreads include\n» Call ratio spreads\n» Put ratio spreads\nThe following sections discuss these spreads along with risk profiles and basic\nguidelines to consider when employing them.\nA ratio spread has limited reward with risk that is either high or unlimited.

However, it’s worth working on as a paper-trade\nexercise so you can see for yourself as well as cementing key concepts in options\ntrading.\nAlways contact your broker to obtain their specific margin and maintenance\nrequirements for option combination positions.\nPutting a ratio spread\nA put ratio spread\n» Includes a long option plus a greater number of short options expiring the\nsame month, with the short options having a lower strike price\n» Should be implemented for an initial credit\n» Generally uses a 1:2 or 2:3 ratio for long to short put options\n» Is best when a reverse price skew exists for IV because the lower strike price\noptions are being sold\n» Is an unlimited-risk position with high margins required due to one or more\nuncovered short puts\nThe net credit for the position is the credit received from selling the short, lower-\nstrike puts minus the debit required to purchase the long, lower-strike put.\nAlthough IV may be high for the short options when the position is initiated,\nmaximum profits are achieved when the stock moves to the short option strike\nprice at expiration.\nBecause a put ratio spread includes an unprotected short put option, you should\ndesign and be prepared to execute an exit criteria. Do this before you establish the\nposition to minimize your risk if the underlying stock moves downward in price\nby a substantial amount below the put strike price of the short option or by more\nthan the difference between the long and short put strikes.\nAlways ask yourself, before you pull the trigger on a trade, “What if I’m wrong on\nmy outlook?” Know your risk.\nCalculations for risk, reward, and breakevens for this position are similar to the\ncall ratio spread, with some minor adjustments. A put ratio spread is a limited but\nhigh risk, as displayed by the risk graph in Figure 15-9.\nRatio spreads generally rely on moderate movement once established.\nCHAPTER 15 Letting Volatility Show You the Way to Trading Opportunities 309",

This means the following:\n» Capitalizing on a forward price skew when creating a call ratio spread\n» Capitalizing on a reverse price skew when creating a put ratio spread\nAdditional conditions to seek for ratio spreads include the following:\n» Call ratio spread: When implementing this strategy, you should also have a\nneutral outlook on the stock because these conditions yield profits or limited\nrisk.

The range of\nprofitability for a ratio spread is dictated by both the long and short option strike\nprices, but generally tends to be narrow when implemented for a credit. As a\nresult, the best conditions to implement a ratio spread occur when there has been\nrecent volatility in price of the underlying and that volatility is expected to\nsubside.\nDeciding your strategy\nWhen deciding on which strategy to use, consider both current market conditions\nand your future outlook for those conditions. Here are two areas to consider for\noption trading:\n» Directional bias: Bullish, bearish, or sideways (neutral)\n» Volatility bias: Implied volatility and stock volatility\nYou can identify the current directional and volatility bias with price and volatility\ncharts. Because volatility displays stronger seasonal tendencies and is often driven\nby scheduled reports, you can generally identify a more reliable IV outlook for the\nfuture price.\nMartin Zweig, a great market timer from the 1970s and 1980s, always said, “Don’t\nfight the market’s momentum.” Truer words were never spoken.

As a straight\nstock or exchange-traded fund (ETF) trader, these trendless market periods are\ndifficult to handle, especially if you use the markets as part of your overall income.\nIn addition, the ability to make investment-related income with low risk, such as\nwhat money market funds used to provide in the past, has been worsened during\nthe period of time after the 2008 mortgage crisis where central banks lowered\ninterest rates to levels near zero — a dynamic whose future isn’t likely to be\nresolved for some time in the future given the high levels of debt in the world and\nthe difficulties caused in financial markets and economies when central banks try\nto raise interest rates. This chapter discusses making money even when the mar-\nket is going nowhere and when interest rates are so low that saving fails to pro-\nduce interest income.\nOption strategies are different from straight stocks or ETF trading, because they\nallow you to realize profits when markets move sideways. By using options, you\ncan reap additional rewards on existing positions or trade the markets with lim-\nited risk. Long butterflies and condors are two such strategies I introduce in this\nchapter. And although these strategies are complex, they’re ideal for sideways\nmarkets because they can produce income or moderate gains as you manage the\nposition, while limiting risk.\nCHAPTER 16 Trading Profitably When Markets Move Sideways 325",

If you\nanswer yes to the second question, I recommend that you read this chapter any-\nway, because it may change your mind or give you something you can use in your\noverall trading strategies anyway.\nIdentifying Winning Positions\nin Sideways Markets\nWhen the markets move sideways you have three choices:\n» Deal with stagnant returns on existing positions.\n» Find gains with new positions.\n» Stay clear of all trading. Good luck with this one, especially during periods of\nlow interest rates when markets go sideways.\nThe fact is that a trendless market can be like an ancient method of slow torture,\nwhere each moment is worse than the one that preceded it. That’s because when\nsideways movement persists, you end up wondering whether you should close out\ncurrent positions and whether you’ll miss out on gains or incur losses when things\nget moving again (up or down). But you don’t have to go through this torture\nbecause you can still trade options profitably during these periods by using the\nright strategies. Indeed, a sideways market is an optionable trend — another\nchallenge, albeit one that requires a special set of trading techniques. With this in\nmind, read the following sections and look first at position management when the\nmarket settles into a sideways-trading range.\nManaging existing positions\nLong calls allow you to realize gains from bullish moves, whereas long puts allow\nyou to realize gains from bearish moves.

If you’re not comfortable combining positions in a single strategy or\nunaware of the multiple choices of personal combinations available to you, check\nout Chapter 12.\nAs a starting point, consider adding options to existing stock or ETFs to boost\nreturns when the markets seem to be directionless. Make sure you contemplate\nthese strategies so you have the best chance of success in sideways markets. In\nfact, part of your management strategy is to be aware that sideways markets can\nchange into trending markets, so look out for potential changes in the trend —\nfrom sideways to up-or downtrends — and be prepared to manage the position\naccordingly.\nAs a general rule for initiating new positions, you want to sell premium (sell\noptions) when implied volatility (IV) is relatively high and buy options when it is\nrelatively low.\nIn the next sections I describe a great example of how to manage a sideways trade\nthat morphs into a trending trade.\nSideways gains: ASO\nThis example is a real-life trade of a covered call strategy during a sideways-\ntrading period featuring the shares of sporting goods retailer Academy Sports and\nOutdoors (ASO) that I traded and featured on my website www.joeduartein\nthemoneyoptions.com/ during early 2021. Figure 16-1 is the visual record.\nAcademy went public in October 2020 and began an aggressive rally that entered\nan extended consolidation period in February 2021. I bought the stock originally in\nNovember 2020, rode the rally up all the way, and remained bullish on the stock\nthroughout the consolidation. However, I didn’t want to just sit there and wait, so\nI started looking at possible option strategies that could produce some income\nwhile I waited to see which way the stock would break.\nAs I dug deeper into the stock, I found the following:\n» The company had an earnings report due on March 30, 2021.\n» Historical Volatility (HV) was 35.\n» Implied Volatility (IV) was 85.\nCHAPTER 16 Trading Profitably When Markets Move Sideways 327",

That theory was\nconfirmed by the fact that ADI was falling because short-sellers were driving the\nprice down. At the same time, OBV was rising, which suggested that even as the\nshort-sellers were betting against the shares, other investors, possibly algos,\nmarket makers, and even company insiders were buying the stock on the dips to\nthe bottom of the trading range.\nWhen ADI is falling and OBV is rising, it can be a sign that algos are quietly\nbuilding long positions by buying on dips in expectations that the price will even-\ntually rise.\nOn top of the shares I already owned, I bought 100 shares of ASO on March 29,\n2021, for $25 and simultaneously sold to open 1 ASO 4/16/21 $30 call option for\n$1.00.

Note: The option expired within 16 days\nof the trade date, which was perfect. The fact that it netted a $1 premium was\nexcellent and a direct result of the high IV.\nI wasn’t completely sure of which way things would go, though, so I bought ASO\non April 6 $20 put option for $0.35 on March 29 as well and set up a collar, just in\ncase the stock cratered on a bad earnings report.\nWhen the report came out, the shares moved decidedly higher. Because I didn’t\nwant to be assigned on the call, I bought to close the call option for $0.60 and\nsimultaneously sold 100 shares of ASO for $27. The put option became worthless\nbecause the stock rallied, so the net gain for this trade: $200 (stock gain) – $40\n(option buy back) – $35 by letting the put option expire worthless was $125.\nSelling a call against a long stock position doesn’t protect it — it moderately\nreduces risk by reducing your net costs. Also, the further IV is from HV, the higher\nthe odds of the underlying moving and these conditions favor option sellers.\nFigure 16-1 shows the period of consolidation (ellipse) and the breakout (arrow)\nafter the earnings report. The stock rallied for a few days and entered another\nconsolidation period with similar technical characteristics (ADI, OBV, shrinking\nBollinger Bands), but with one big difference: IV fell back to where it was close to\nHV. As a result, I didn’t sell more options on ASO during that period.

The strategy may work best on an existing position.\n» The double-edged sword of IV may result in conditions where you’re better off\nselling your LEAPS contract, which may have declined less than the underlying\nasset itself.\nIn addition to a LEAPS strategy, additional income may be generated from a cal-\nendar strategy using simply an existing long call. In this case, shorter-term calls\nare sold against a long call for the same underlying. Risk is moderately reduced by\ndecreasing your net investment in the position, and the same considerations apply\nas those listed for a LEAPS short call approach.

Some characteristics of the strategy include the following:\n» Has limited risk and limited reward\n» Can be created using exclusively calls or exclusively puts\n» Combines two vertical spreads\n» Is shorter term in design\n» Is generally created for a debit when you are buying a long butterfly\n» Maximizes gains when the underlying security remains within a trading range\ndictated by the option strike prices\nA variation on the basic butterfly is the iron butterfly, which combines calls and\nputs. Selling a variation of the butterfly, the iron condor, is generally created for a\ncredit with time decay working in its favor.\nA sideways moving market can also be referred to as trendless or directionless. An\nolder terminology credited to veteran technical analyst Stan Weinstein called a\nsideways market a Stage 1 Market, with Stage 2 being a rising market, Stage 3\nbeing a topping market, and Stage 4 being a declining market.\nThe following sections delve deeper into the different types of butterfly strategies\nand how you can use them in your options trading.\nDefining the butterfly\nAs with most of the strategies in this book, the butterfly, similar to rhinestone\nshades and cheap sunglasses, comes in two varieties:\n» Long call butterfly\n» Long put butterfly\nBoth of these strategies combine a vertical credit spread and a vertical debit spread\nto capitalize on sideways moves in the markets.

This can vary when butterflies are created OTM for\ndirectional bets.\nAlways consider more than one strategy as possibly being suitable to current mar-\nket conditions. You may decide that an alternate strategy does a better job of\nreducing your risk.\nCall butterfly\nA long call butterfly combines a bull call spread and bear call spread, using the\nsame strike price for the short leg of each. It’s a limited-risk, limited-reward posi-\ntion that’s profitable during range-bound trading for the underlying stock or ETF.\nThe butterfly is constructed by creating two spreads:\n» A bull call spread with a short option strike price that is near the money or ATM\n» A bear call spread with the same short option strike price as the bull call spread\nThe maximum risk for the position is the initial debit, which is determined by\nsubtracting the bear call spread credit from the bull call spread debit. (See\nChapter 11 for more information on vertical spreads.)\nThe best way to think about risks and rewards for a butterfly is to remember that\nit combines two vertical spreads.\nThe long call butterfly strike prices compare to the spread strikes as follows:\n» The lower strike price long call in the bull call spread is the lowest strike price\ncall in the butterfly position and serves as the first wing.\n» The two short options represent the next higher strike price and represent\nthe body.\n» The last call is the highest strike price in the group and comes from the long\ncall in the bear call spread position.\nWhen the short options are approximately ATM, profits are highest if the stock\nmoves very little and closes at the short option strike price on the last trading day\nCHAPTER 16 Trading Profitably When Markets Move Sideways 335",

It’s late July . . . vacation doldrums . . . market’s flat.

This applies to both call-and-put long butterflies. In general, the\nfollowing hold true:\n» Using an OTM option for the body increases directional bias.\n» Increasing the spread distance expands the range of profitability but adds to\nyour costs.\n» Increasing the spread distance decreases the reward-risk ratio.\nIf you have a slightly bearish-to-neutral outlook, you can purchase a put butterfly\nusing an OTM instead of ATM body.\nPaper trading helps you see how these tradeoffs impact your trade success without\nhaving money on the line during your learning curve. Paper trading is especially\nuseful in implementing these more complex strategies.\nNarrow wings — smaller risk\nWhen you decrease the spread distance for long butterflies, you also decrease the\nrisk and the probability of profit, which is also true for vertical spreads. By using\nthe DIA long call butterfly spread example and narrowing the spread, Table 16-1\nprovides the position impact.\nTABLE 16-1 Narrowing the Spread for Aug DIA Butterflies\nButterfly Breakeven Butterfly\nStrikes Butterfly Risk Max Reward Reward- Risk Range Delta\n105-106-107 30 7 0 2.33 1.3% –3.7\n104-106-108 75 125 1.67 2.4% –10.1\n103-106-109 140 160 1.14 3.0% –16.6\nCHAPTER 16 Trading Profitably When Markets Move Sideways 343",

Regardless, using past HV and IV data provides you with valuable information\nwhen evaluating strategies because it frames the potential for future movements\nand allows you to make better educated guesses about potential positions.\nSuppose a stock is trading at $134.45.

In this particular example of a five-point con-\ndor spread, your risk of 2.45 using the condor is almost 1-1 with your potential\nreward of 2.55. Your risk of 1.25 using the five-point butterfly spread, on the other\nhand, is only one third your potential reward of 3.75. Larger potential reward\nmeans lower probability of profit, however.

I certainly don’t recommend trading condors and butter-\nflies at the start of your options trading career. Yet this level of complexity is what\nit takes to make the right decision. The take-home message is that as an options\ntrader, when using these types of strategies, you must decide whether the higher\nprobability of profit using a condor is worth the larger potential loss while gaining\na smaller potential reward.\nSimilar strategies will provide different advantages and disadvantages in terms of\nrisk, reward, and breakeven, depending on a variety of factors. Be sure to evaluate\na few alternatives.\nThe actual comparison between different strategy statistics is impacted by the\nspecific underlying stock, option strike prices, and spreads used.

Sometimes you have to rely on your gut, and that’s what separates\nyou and me from the algos. Of course, it’s best if your gut has had experi-\nence in telling you what to do, has a good record of calling it right when you need\nit to deliver the goods, and has sound strategic evidence to back up its calls as well\nas a killer trading plan to base difficult decisions on. Indeed, you can teach your\ngut to help you by having a sound trading plan; creating that foundation allows\nyou to make the right decision regarding your trades as often as possible.\n(Chapter 8 examines more details about creating your plan.)\nTrading (and this book) is about developing specific rules and reliable steps to fol-\nlow as part of a process that gets you up and running on a path toward making\nmoney consistently via sound risk management. Trading is also equally about\nimplementing these rules and the steps required so that you develop your craft at\nyour own pace — and to give your gut something to work with.\nTherefore, developing a strategy list that lets you methodically approach a new\ntype of trade in a way and gain the most knowledge and experience possible at\nyour own pace is a great first step. Furthermore, consider organizing these strate-\ngies in categories that allow you to combine key shared characteristics.

Buying a put for exist-\ning stock or rolling out an option to a later expiration month remains true to that\nstrategy goal. Long out-of-the-money (OTM) options should be sold 30 to 45 days\nbefore expiration. This strategy is best used when you’re not 100 percent sure of\nthe stock in the short term, such as before an earnings announcement or when the\nmarket looks risky, but you’d like to hold the stock for the longer term.

Use this strategy when you expect the underly-\ning security to make a rapid move in the direction of the spread’s near month\nshort strike but not further.\nBy doing this you give yourself room to enable a substantial roll credit base on\ntime-value differential when you buy to close the near-month short option and\nsell to open a later-month short option. Spreads in general are best used when\nyou’re looking to participate in the dominant trend of the underlying with less\ncapital than straight ownership of the underlying. A call diagonal is described\nhere, but a put diagonal works equally well when you’re bearish longer term. See\nTable 17-5 for a summary of investment strategies and Figure 17-5 for an example\nof the profile.\nTABLE 17-5 Call Diagonal Spread Summary\nStrategy Outcome\nComponents Long Lower Strike Call + Short, Near Month Call\nRisk/Reward Limited risk, potential unlimited reward*\nReplaces Long Call\nMax Risk (Long Call Price – Short Call Price) × 100\nMax Reward * Unlimited when short call expires worthless\nBreakeven Detailed\nConditions Neutral with IV time skew, then trending\nMargin Required\nAdvantages Reduces cost of long option\nDisadvantages A large bullish move beyond the short near-term call\nstrike results in limited reward\nA diagonal spread is more aggressive than a straight vertical spread but offers\na potentially higher return from selling additional time value through roll credits.\n364 PART 5 The Part of Tens",

This strategy is useful\nto set up before an important announcement such as an earnings or key economic\nreport release.

But just about anyone who takes the time to learn what it\ntakes to do it right can master it by focusing on each particular part of the\nwhole one step at a time. In fact, just as with most tasks, in the end trading is all\nabout preparation and attention to detail, with the understanding that things\ncould go against you and that risk management is your first objective.\nMarkets don’t care who you are or what you stand for. All they know is that you\nhave money that they want to take from you. Therefore, to become a trader, you\nmust understand that fact so deeply that it becomes part of your DNA, or you’ll\nlose a lot of money in a hurry.\nThat’s why developing as a trader requires a formula-type trading plan to guide\nyour approach to the markets that you can adapt to different strategies as called\nfor by market conditions. Skillfully applying your trading plan as a seasoned pro\nrequires practice, patience, and experience. Indeed, it’s a journey that, ideally, you\nmust welcome, hone, and implement as part of your life.\nThis chapter focuses on ten of the rules, steps, and methods to do and not do when\ntrading options.\nCHAPTER 18 Ten Do’s and Don’ts in Options Trading 373",

In fact, when people\nask you about your trading and what you do, tell them you’re a risk manager. “Be\nthe risk manager, Danny.” How’s that for nuance and knowledge of movies from\nthe late ’70s?\nBy exploring option strategies, you’re actively addressing other financial risks in\nyour life. These include inflation risk, income risk, and even market risk associ-\nated with buy-and-hold investing. The study of options trading — because it’s all\nabout risk management, attention to detail, and the creation of an exit plan before\nyou make a decision to trade in real time — is likely to subconsciously rewire the\nway your brain looks at the markets, and perhaps life because it forces you to be\nmore thoughtful and systematic about the things you do.\nWhen your trading is built on risk-management principles, you train yourself to\n» Thoroughly understand the risks and rewards associated with the markets\nyou trade.\n» Learn and test strategies before putting money on the line.\n» Create a plan that identifies trade sizes entry and exit approaches and\nmaximum loss allowed.\n» Identify how the plan will be implemented to honor your risk parameters.\n» Understand how to establish positions and manage a trade, including\ncommunication with your broker regarding any margin requirements for\ncomplex options strategies.\n» Have a plan for taking profits.\n» Ask yourself, “What if I’m wrong?”\nOther more general risk considerations include diversifying sectors and strategies\ntraded. You may properly allocate trade sizes, but if you enter five trending trades\nusing the same strategy on stocks in the same sector, you’ve gone against that\ntrade-sizing rule. That’s the nuance. By extending these guidelines on a portfolio\nbasis, you’re acting more as an effective risk manager.\n374 PART 5 The Part of Tens",

What that\nmeans is that one way or another, you’ll have losses in your trading. It’s not a\nbeginner’s trait; it’s simply a cost of doing business. Every trader makes losing\ntrades, so turn this reality into an advantage. Indeed, taking small losses is a skill\nthat’s developed by experienced traders. Try to get to that level sooner than later.\nLet me make that clear. When you trade, you aren’t looking to lose money. But\nwhen you’re a risk manager, you recognize that losses are part of the game, and\nthus by design you plan to keep losses small when things go against you.\nAvoiding losses is a sure way to make them bigger. You can follow your rules and\nsee positive results with a series of small gains and losses, only to have the slate\nwiped clean (and then some) with one big loss. It’s a discouraging setback, and one\nthat will happen no matter what you do, because you don’t control the markets.\nAnd sometimes you can win by losing. The key is to change the way you think\nabout trading. By shifting your view of what constitutes a successful trade from\none that is profitable to one that follows your rules, you’re on your way to true\nsuccess. That’s so counterintuitive that it will be difficult.",

That’s so counterintuitive that it will be difficult. In fact, you can tell\nyourself to do it, but most often you only become a true believer with experience.\nAs it happens, you become more committed to a rules-based approach, which is\nwhen the shift occurs.\nHere’s an example: I once lost 30 percent on a speculative biotech stock when a\nclinical trial went bust. It hurt. And it cost me a lot of money. But that loss made me\ndig so deeply into that company and the design of the faulty clinical trial that\nI learned more than a valuable trading lesson. I found out how to spot bad manage-\nment in a company and how to discern whether the risk benefit ratio is worthwhile\nbefore investing in that type of stock when the end result of the trade depends on\none single event. That 30 percent loss turned into an immeasurable advantage from\nwhich I’ve profited many times over because I’ve become more detail oriented in\nmy analysis of how companies run their business. Moreover, I’ve essentially stopped\ntrading similar companies, a fact that has saved me lots of money and heartache.\nDo Trade with Discipline\nTrading with discipline means following the rules detailed in your trading plan\non each and every trade. Do this not some of the time, or most of the time, but\nevery time. Will you have a perfect record on the discipline front? Probably\nnot . . . somewhere along the way, your human emotions will get the better of you.\nIt will happen. But don’t worry. It takes time.

Indeed, if you lack\ndiscipline early on, and you’re fortunate enough to remain in the trading game,\nyou may be in more trouble than you realize. The fact is, your luck will eventually\nrun out and you’ll be sorry. Continue to work at it so that your discipline continu-\nally improves. Otherwise, it’s just a matter of time before your luck will run out,\nand so will your money.\nUnfortunately, those experiencing initial success may delay an appreciation and\ncommitment to disciplined trading. Early success can give you a false feeling of\nbeing right, which isn’t what trading is about. Never forget this. Trading is about\nmaking money.\nCharacteristics of trading with discipline on each trade include the following:\n» Allocating a reasonable amount of money to a trade\n» Identifying a maximum risk for the trade\n» Identifying entry and exit signals\n» Executing an order when your plan requires it\nThose are the checklist items, but trading with discipline goes beyond this. Doing\nyour homework, reviewing your trades, assessing your plan . . . a comprehensive\nlist would take the rest of this chapter.

If you’re\nnot up to it today, come back tomorrow. It will still be there.\nMonitoring your emotions is the first step to managing them.

When I was less experienced, I’d immediately sell. But that’s what the\nalgos want you to do: to be emotional and hasty so they can buy your stock or\noption from you for a lot less and then sell it to somebody else later for a big profit.\nMore often than not by the time I start looking at trades, 30 minutes into the day,\nthe same positions that opened down in response to the news have made up a\ngood deal of ground and I don’t have to sell them at that particular time. That’s\nbecause the algos buy when people panic. In fact, some of the time, I’ll use that\ntemporary decline at the open to add to or to fine-tune an option strategy.\nConsider reading books written by great traders as a guide to your own plan. The\nseminal trading book is called Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefevre.\nYou can find updated versions online, but if you can find a copy of the original\nedition, it’s worth your while because it gives you an in-depth look at the mind of\na master trader, Jesse Livermore, one of the few lucky ones who sold before the\ncrash of 1929.\nDon’t Suffer from Analysis Paralysis\nIf you like playing around with numbers, the economy and financial markets pro-\nvide you with an endless supply of them. You could probably go years seeking out\nrelationships between different measures, trying to obtain market timing signals.\nCHAPTER 18 Ten Do’s and Don’ts in Options Trading 379",

The truth is that sometimes they’ll work and\nsometimes they won’t. That’s because even though the data may be sound, the\nmarket is, by nature, predictably unpredictable.\nGoing live will change everything. Just like singers can nail the notes at sound\ncheck but sometimes miss during a real performance, paper trading it the whole\ntime won’t necessarily get you any closer to successfully trading. At some point,\nyou need to experience the markets, where you, the human trader, will respond\ndifferently in a live trade.\nPart of trading successfully means managing your emotions, not removing them.\nThere’s another side to that, because you also bring great emotions and traits to\nthe trading table. Confidence becomes so important when the market picture\nbegins to get hazy — it’s what keeps you following your reasonably tested rules.\nThere is a point of balance. Because the market with all its data can provide some\ninteresting diversions, it can also keep you from the task at hand. After all your\nlearning, reviewing, testing, practicing, and analyzing are done for a strategy, tak-\ning it live provides experience that solidifies your understanding of it all. If it’s your\nfirst time trading options, use limited-risk strategies and proper trade sizes to gain\nthat experience. And if all goes well, you’ll also make some money along the way.\nMoreover, trust the indicators that really work.",

This indicator works consistently to\npredict where the key support and resistance levels of the market are, especially\non an intraday basis. And for longer-term trading analysis, the New York Stock\nExchange Advance-Decline Line (NYAD) is highly reliable.\nDo Take Responsibility for Your Results\nDon’t take this personally, but your trading results are all on you. In his book\nTrader Vic: Methods of a Wall Street Master (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), veteran trader\nVic Sperandeo talks about how he lost a lot of money one day on a trade because\nhis wife called him to tell him about how her hair dryer was malfunctioning. He\nadmits he should have told her to call him back later. Instead, he listened to her\nsympathetically, but lost his shirt on the trade. Maybe he should have closed out\nthe trade or had a rule in place that he wasn’t going to answer the phone while\nactively trading. At the end of the day, it was his fault, not hers, that he lost\nmoney. Never, ever, ever shift any responsibility for your trading results on any-\none or anything but you.

It makes\nit too elusive.\n380 PART 5 The Part of Tens\n\n[Page 395]\nIn your trading career, different situations or problems will certainly arise that\nimpact trade profitability. If there’s a problem with executions, consider how\nyou’re placing the orders and discuss it with your broker. If problems persist,\nremedy it by shifting a portion of your assets to another broker and measure those\nresults.\nWhen you don’t have sufficient time for your standard analysis due to work con-\nstraints, personal commitments, or whatever, shift to strategies that you do have\ntime to do the right way or don’t trade at all. If you don’t have sufficient time,\nstepping away from trading is your only responsible choice. Don’t worry. The\nmarkets and the algos will still be there chugging away and waiting for your\nmoney when you’re able to get back to them. And when you do, you’ll have pre-\nserved some assets for trading and your mind will be clear enough to put up a\ngood fight.\nIn the end, by always acknowledging the fact that you’re responsible for your own\nresults, you’ll seek solutions faster and take control. You don’t have to wait for\nsomeone else to take action or for some event to occur. Accepting responsibility\nearly in the game helps you assert much greater command over your learning\ncurve and accelerates successful trading.\nDon’t Stop Learning\nNo single strategy or analytic technique works every single time. If a sure-fire\nstrategy did, everyone would be using it. The changing nature of the markets\nmakes avoiding this fact almost impossible.",

Here are some quick thoughts to help you when creating your continued\neducation plan:\n» When mastering strategies, you’ll find topics you want to understand better.\nAddress those in a focused manner through self-study (including books,\naudiobooks, podcasts, websites, and periodicals).\n» Move on to additional analysis forms and strategies through more formal\neducation if needed (live courses online and/or offline or self-study).\n» Start the year with general topic goals (for example, learn two strategies and\nmore on technical analysis), along with more specific goals (such as find\nstrategies benefiting in sideways trending markets or better understand intermar-\nket analysis).\nDo Love the Game\nTrading is an intellectual challenge; not because it requires a PhD, but because it\nrequires a combination of observation, planning, reaction, and frequent revision\nof what you do and how you do it. As a result, if you do it correctly, it will take up\na lot of your time. And if it takes up your time, you had better enjoy it or things\nwon’t go well.\nTherefore, regardless of how much any trader may complain, successful traders\nlove what they do.

The objective of this paper is to conduct empirical analysis of traditional RSI Vs. volume\nbased RSI on a set of most frequently traded stocks traded in National Stock Exchange. The current study tries\nto explain the effect of volume on stock price. In day trading it is believed that on any day if there is increased\nvolume trading on ask side of a stock, it means there is a greater demand for that stock as the demand side is\nhigher than the supply side. Changes in stock volume signify that there is some information related to the stock,\neither positive information or negative information which created a euphoria in the minds of traders.

Introduction:\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) acts as an effective technical indicator which measures the\nmomentum of recent price changes. RSI indicates overbought or oversold position for a stock or an asset. It is\nalso known as the oscillator and its value ranges from 0 to 100. RSI was invented by J. Weller Wilder Jr. in his\nbook entitled “New concepts in Technical Trading Systems”. The current study introduces volume based RSI\nwhich takes into consideration the trading volume.\nProblem Statement: Technical analysis involves making short term buy or sell decisions by considering the\nhistorical prices of the stock and also forecasting the future price movements based on historical prices\ncollected. The assumption behind technical analysis is “History repeats” i.e., the future stock prices are guided\nby the past price movements. Therefore it is important to note that previous stock prices are required to forecast\ntheir future evolution.\nTechnical analysis has been the popular tool which was widely used in the stock market and till today it has not\nlost its significance.",

Literature Review:\nThere are a plethora of research conducted on Technical oscillators such as RSI, MACD and Bollinger\nbands. Some of the significant ones are mentioned below:\n(Terence Tai-Leung Chong, 2014) Examined two most frequently used technical indicators namely\nMoving Average Convergence and Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) as a measure of\nprofitability.

The authors selected the closing prices of a set of stocks from Auto, IT and oil\nindustry for one year. Out of analysis it was concluded by the authors that Bollinger bands gave a higher returns\ncompared to RSI.\n(Dr. Bhargavi. R, 2017) In this study the authors make a comparative analysis of P/E ratio with EPS.\nFor the study 20 scripts were chosen out of which 10 scripts were chosen with highest P/E ratio and another 10\nscripts with highest EPS were chosen. After analysis using RSI it was found that P/E ratio was a better indicator\nof profitability than EPS.\n(Choudhuri, July 2019) In another significant study conducted by Sajjan Choudhuri a comparative\nanalysis of buy and hold strategy was done against the RSI strategy. The author compared the profits derived\nfrom buy and hold strategy with RSI signal on 30 stocks which are the components of SENSEX. From this\nstudy it was found that the signals given by RSI are very strong compared to buy and hold strategy.\n(Alhilfi, January 2019) This study was with related to investment pattern of Iraqi Stock Exchange.

The author found that speculators who invested in Bank of Baghdad were\nbetter able to predict the prices of stock using RSI and also they were able to forecast the price.\nIII. Research Methodology:\nCalculation of Classic RSI:\nFor the present study a comparative study is done using classic form of RSI and adjusted form of RSI. RSI is\nused to represent the relative strength of a security’s return in comparison with market return. For determining\nRSI, we have to determine the highest closing price (change in upward movement represented by U) or lowest\nclosing price (the downward change represented by (D) as follows:\nU Close = TCP – YCP...................................................(1)\nD Close = YCP – TCP.............................................(2)\nWhere TCP = Today’s Closing Price, YCP = Yesterday’s Closing Price\nBy looking at the above formula it can be made out that on a particular day U and D values are mutually\nexclusive events. Therefore if U is positive for a particular day, the value of D is taken as 0 and vice versa.\nIn addition to this an exponential moving average (EMA) is calculated for U and D in order to eliminate the\ninfluence of random factors which seems to be unusual for the averages. This EMA is computed using a\n“multiplier” called α for a specific number of days.\nThe number of days to be considered is 14 days as mentioned by Mr. Wilder but for EMA the author has\nconsidered 27 days for number of days in his book.",

This EMA is computed using a\n“multiplier” called α for a specific number of days.\nThe number of days to be considered is 14 days as mentioned by Mr. Wilder but for EMA the author has\nconsidered 27 days for number of days in his book. The α multiplier will act as weighted average, giving higher\nweightage to recent stock prices and less weightage to older prices. The α multiplier is determined using the\nformula:\n......................................................(3)\nIf we consider the number of days as 27 for example, then α value will be equal to 1/14. Computation of EMA\ninvolves computation of Simple Arithmetic Average (SMA) for the data of first N days in the price under\nconsideration. The SMA can be computed by using the formula:\n............................................(4)\nWhere is the simple arithmetic average of a series of data corresponding to N number of days, is the\nstock price corresponding to Nth day of the data set. It is important to note that while calculating RSI either X =\nU or X = D.\nThe formula for determining exponential moving average for N+1 date is given below:\n.................................(5)\nOnce we compute exponential moving averages of the Upper closing prices Relative strength can be calculated\nusing the following formula:\n.................................(6)\nFinally the relative strength index is computed by using the formula\n......................................(7)\nThe value of RSI will range from 30 to 70. An RSI value of 30 or below 30 represents the stock is\noversold which shows that the stock is undervalued. An RSI score of 70 and above shows that the stock is\noverbought and the stock is overvalued. RSI values are interpreted differently under different market\nconditions. For instance if the market is highly volatile then an RSI score between 20 and 80 can be used\nDOI: 10.9790/487X-2307014851 www.iosrjournals.org 49 | Page",

At the same time if the market is bullish the traders can rely upon buying signals and\nwhen the market is bearish it is preferred that traders should rely upon sell signals.\nThe divergence between the graphs can also lead to buy or sell signals which shows the evolution of\nRSI. When RSI graph reaches maximum which is higher than the last high price and also when RSI chart\nreaches below maximum which is below the previous maximum price the indicator will show a buy signal and\nvice versa. The buy or sell signal will be more significant if the difference between RSI chart and the data graph\nappears after some point of time during which the index shows oversold and overbought position.\nThe average level for RSI is assumed to be at 50 units. If the value of RSI exceeds 50 in upward\ndirection from base 50 then the market is said to be bullish. And when the RSI value breaks out 50 from top to\nbase then it is an indication of bearish trend.\nThe volume adjusted form of RSI:\nThe classic form of RSI considers only the stock price without taking into account the volume of stock\ntraded. Volume plays a significant role while making buy and sell decisions. Hence the adjusted form of RSI\ntakes into consideration the price of the underlying asset along with volume traded. Both the indicators put\ntogether create strong signals which are more powerful in making buy or sell decisions.",

The formula to compute volume adjusted form of RSI is given below:\n........................................(8)\nWhere RSP/V is the volume adjusted Relative Strength, EMA of UP/V is the exponential moving average of the\nprice to volume increase which happens over a period of N days, EMA DP/V is the exponential moving average\nof price to volume decrease which took place over a period of N years.

Apart from the above\nchanges all other interpretations made in case of classic form of RSI will remain the same.\nSources of data: For the present study the secondary data of the adjusted closing price of Nifty 50\nindex is collected from Yahoo Finance. The difference between closing price and adjusted closing price is that\nthe adjusted closing price is adjusted to the market sentiments observed due to corporate actions such as Follow\non public offer, stock splits and dividend issue. The time duration considered for the study includes 1st March\n2016 to 1st March 2021 which includes a period of 5 years. With regard to the period under consideration it is\nimportant note that the study takes into consideration the impact of Covid 19 on the stock prices which started in\nIndia from 1st March 2020. Year 2020 has been a remarkable year in the history of India and also the World due\nto outbreak of Covid-19 virus. The current study examines the profitability of volume adjusted RSI with the\nclassic form of RSI.\nIV. Results and Discussion:\nFor the present study the empirical data was used to verify the profitability of classic form of RSI with\nthe volume adjusted RSI. 30 & 70 are used as the standard points for classic form of RSI and 37.5 & 62.5 are\nused as the benchmarks for volume adjusted RSI. N is 14 days for computation of EMA value. The results are\nclassified into two segments, the first segment consists of classic form of RSI and the second segment consists\nof volume adjusted form of RSI.\nResults pertaining to Classic form RSI:\nWhen the RSI closes the day on a level which is found to be above the signal or support level, then it\ngives a sell signal. It was assumed that the selling of one unit of NIFTY 50 will happen in the first day of\ntrading. Simultaneously the open position will be closed as and when RSI reaches either the maximum\nresistance value again or a level which was found to be quite below 50 points, whichever the scenario that\noccurs first.\nDOI: 10.9790/487X-2307014851 www.iosrjournals.org 50 | Page",

Buying one unit of NIFTY 50 will take place on\nthe very first day of the trading day, when RSI reaches a level which is quite above the minimum value.

The overall\ngain due to volume adjusted RSI is 768.09 points.\nV. Conclusion:\nFrom the above results and discussions it is found that the gains generated under volume adjusted form\nof RSI is comparatively greater than the gains from classic form of RSI. From the above results it can be stated\nthat both the forms of RSI will predict the short term continuation of the price movements in the underlying\nstock but they fail to predict the trend which persists for a longer duration of time. Therefore it can be\nconcluded that Volume adjusted RSI is comparatively more profitable than the classic form.\nReferences:\n[1]. Alhilfi, M. (January 2019).

Putting money into a securities market — and\ntaking it out with a gain — is no different: You need good timing to get the best\nresults.\nTechnical traders all over the world, amateur and professional alike, earn a living\nusing technical analysis to time their trades in many different markets. And\nthey’re still standing after a market crash, unlike many so-called value investors.\nIn this book, I try to explain how they do that and how you can do it, too.\nAbout This Book\nThe technical analysis industry is expanding at an exponential pace. A few years\nago, an Internet search for the term “technical analysis” returned 206 million\nresponses. Now it returns 1.36 billion responses. Even after weeding out duplicates\nand mismatches, it’s still a huge amount of material. Don’t be intimidated by the\nsheer size of the available material. In this fourth edition of Technical Analysis For\nDummies, I cover the core concepts, most of which you could apply today with no\nfurther research. If you were to explore the most advanced entry in the 1.36 billion\nentries, most of it would be familiar to you from reading this book.\nTechnical ideas range from the super simple to the tremendously complex. I cover\nthe core concepts that are the building blocks of all, or nearly all, of those tremen-\ndously complex systems. It’s up to you to choose to stay with one of two simple\nideas or forge onward to the complex. There is no single best technical idea or\ncombination of ideas, for reasons I explain.\nTechnical analysis is not only a set of tools. It’s also a mindset, a way of looking\nat securities prices and how they wag and what wags them. The first principle of\nthe technical mindset is to throw conventional wisdom out the window and trade\nwhat you see on the chart. Technical analysis is an evidence-based method of\nIntroduction 1",

    "text": "The first principle of\nthe technical mindset is to throw conventional wisdom out the window and trade\nwhat you see on the chart. Technical analysis is an evidence-based method of\nIntroduction 1\n\n[Page 18]\nmaking trading decisions, which means you won’t be consulting earning per\nshare, cash flow, management quality, or any of the other fundamentals that lead\nto an assessment of value. Technical analysis isn’t value investing. Value investing\nwould have you continue to hold a high-value security despite a big drop in price.\nThe technical analysis trader will sell it, knowing he can always come back after\nthe price bottoms and starts recovering.\nTry to think like a 10-year-old as you read this book.

Focusing on price behavior gives you a window into the mind of\nthe market — what the majority of key players are thinking — and helps you\nmake better trading decisions. Technical analysis seeks to identify and measure\nmarket sentiment, described as optimistic (bullish), pessimistic (bearish), or\nuncertain about future prices (sideways range-trading).\nTo become a technical analyst, you need to figure out how to draw lines on your\nsecurity price chart and work up the courage to place the buy and sell order with\nyour broker. Each type of line is named an indicator, and I cover every major type of\nindicator in this book. You need to figure out whether the line/indicator embodies a\nbullish or bearish outlook (price rising or falling). Many lines/indicators contain a\nhandy built-in buy-and-sell signal, but following those probably won’t match your\nrisk appetite given the amount of capital you have. In practice, you’ll use a computer\nprogram to draw the lines (and to do whatever math underlies the lines). You’ll also\nhave many books and websites to guide you in deciding which lines to draw.\nKnowing how to draw lines is relatively easy. Placing the trades is hard. This is\nbecause your technical-based buy/sell decisions don’t come packaged with how\nmuch to trade, how long to hold, how much risk to take, or even how much risk is\ninvolved.\nCHAPTER 1 Introducing Technical Analysis 7",

Observing prices and shutting\nout other noise has been in development for more than a century. Charles Dow, one of\nthe founders of The Wall Street Journal, observed around the turn of the 20th century\nthat the price of a security neatly cuts through all the clutter of words and is the one\npiece of hard information you can trust, no matter what the other facts about a security\nand what people are saying about it.\nHere are some basic observations underlying technical analysis that are attributed to\nDow himself:\n• Securities prices move in trends much of the time.\n• Trends can be identified with patterns that you see repeatedly (which I cover in\nChapter 9) and with support and resistance trendlines (see Chapter 10).\n• Primary trends (lasting months or years) are punctuated by secondary movements\n(lasting weeks or months) in the opposite direction of the primary trend. Secondary\ntrends, today called retracements, are the very devil to deal with as a trader. (See\nChapter 2 for more on retracements.)\n• Trends remain in place until some major event comes along to stop them.\nThese ideas are part of what is called Dow theory, although Charles Dow himself never\ncalled it that and many ideas are called Dow theory that would surprise Dow. An\nInternet search of the phrase Dow theory yields 23 million hits.",

An\nInternet search of the phrase Dow theory yields 23 million hits. A key point is that traders\nwere using technical ideas long before the advent of electronic communication and\nsoftware programs — technical analysis is hardly a gimmicky fad that will have a short\nshelf life.\nBuilding on Dow theory were Robert D. Edwards and John Magee, whose Technical\nAnalysis of Stock Trends (St. Lucie Press) was the first major book to use the term\n“technical analysis” in the title. It was published in 1948 and has been in print ever\nsince. Edwards and Magee expanded on Dow’s observations, covering many of the\ncore concepts of technical analysis such as support and resistance, breakouts, retrace-\nments, many patterns, and more. Edwards and Magee noted the universal pattern\nof a primary upmove followed by a shallower secondary pullback and then another\nupmove. You’ll see this configuration repeatedly as you explore technical analysis.\nEdwards and Magee were the first to introduce the tools still in use today to evaluate\nthe pattern and to trade it profitably.\n8 PART 1 Getting Started with Technical Analysis",

Something else that differs from Dow’s day is\nthe continuous incursion of the scientific method into everyday life. At the turn of the\nlast century, the scientific method was confined to scientists. Regular people would\ntake a homemade folk remedy for a malady because their grandmother swore by it.\nToday the average person wants to know if that remedy was scientifically tested in\ndouble-blind tests and the results peer-reviewed. The comparable development in\ntechnical analysis is to take an observation about market prices and volume and to\ntest what percentage of the time the observation results in a correct deduction.\nTo help you start, this chapter provides an overview to this book and what you can\nexpect. Consider it your jumping board into this book and the world of technical\nanalysis.\nStepping Up to Science\nIt may be hard to consider drawing lines on a chart as “scientific” in any sense of\nthe word, but it’s through the scientific method that scientists can forecast\noutcomes in the physical world and through the scientific method that you can\nforecast price outcomes in financial markets.",

Technical analysis of securities\nprices follows the scientific method in that it entails systematic observation of the\nsubject with standard measurement methods to form a hypothesis and then\ntesting the hypothesis many, many times to validate the theory. But there’s a\nproblem. In a hard science like fluid dynamics, the thing being observed and\nmeasured is an object — in this case, water. In technical analysis, the thing being\nmeasured isn’t hard — it’s market sentiment generated by human beings, who\nhave far more variability than physical objects. Even given human variability,\nmarket sentiment tends to move in repetitive and predictable ways. Technical\nanalysis gives you the tools to identify which sentiment the market has on display\nat any one time.\nToday’s technical analysis has a wider understanding and appreciation of statis-\ntics and probability, and thus the value and pitfalls of forecasting. The theory of\nprobability originated in the 16th and 17th centuries, but dealt mostly with the\noutcome of games and thus the best way to bet on games. Not until the 1920s and\n1930s did statistics and probability enter the general public mainstream.

The word\n“forecast” makes everybody squeamish because everyone knows stories of\ncatastrophically bad ones. History is full of them, like a top economist saying in\n1929 that the stock market was in fine fettle — just before the crash.\nBut don’t be misled. Although the word is riddled with negative implications,\neveryone makes forecasts all the time. They just don’t think of them as forecasts.\nIn fact, you make forecasts many times every day. You take this travel route over\nsome other route because you forecast it will save time or aggravation. On a larger\nscale, when you move to a new city, take a new job, get married, have children, or\nbuy a house, you’re making a forecast about the outcome. Every life decision you\nmake is a forecast — a bet — almost always made on incomplete or hidden infor-\nmation. Technical analysis entails forecasting, but don’t let that scare you.

Here is a list of some of the impor-\ntant lingo to know:\n» Chart: The workspace of technical analysis is a chart. Much of the time the\nchart will show time along the horizontal axis and price along the vertical axis,\nbut not always. (Some charts are formed differently, as I discuss in Chapter 15).\n» Bar: The price information on the chart is presented in several different\nformats, but usually you’ll see each period’s price as a standard bar showing\nthe price open, high, low, and close. (Refer to Chapter 6 for more about bars.)\nBars, or a series of bars, can be used alone to detect patterns that reveal how\nparticipants in that market feel about the security and therefore what might\nhappen next to the price. (Chapters 7, 8, and 9 discuss how technical analysts\nuse bars to forecast prices.)\n» Candlesticks: Another method of showing the same information that the bar\ndoes is the candlestick bar (see Chapter 8).\n» Lines: Drawing lines on the chart helps forecast future prices. For example,\nyou may draw a line connecting a series of price lows and name it “support,”\nmeaning you expect the traders in this security will see the next low as a\nbuying opportunity, raising the price again.

Indicators comes in all shapes\nand sizes. For example, you see a price chart where the price jumps all over\nthe place. You have no idea whether to buy it or at what price. Now take an\naverage of the closing price over the past 20 days to smooth out the price\njumps. Does that line of averages point up or down? Aha! You may have\nidentified a tradeable trend. I describe a wide range of indicators in\nChapters 12, 13, and 14.\nBuy-and-Hold Is Bunk\nYou may think that active trading is too much work and too uncertain to spend the\ntime on. Why not just buy-and-hold? Buy-and-hold is a philosophy that says most\nequities are best left unattended for long periods of time in your portfolio. They’ll\nrise more or less in sync with the overall economy so that avoiding turnover saves\nyou transactions costs and taxes. Besides, who are you to suggest a security is over\nor undervalued?\nOne reason to distrust buy-and-hold is that over really long periods, returns\naren’t very good at all. Stocks from 1950 to 2018 returned 11.1 percent annually.\nBonds returned 5.8 percent. If you had a 50/50 stock and bond portfolio, you aver-\naged 8.8 percent. The average return on the S&P 500 over the past 30 years is only\nabout 8 percent. In order to get higher returns, you had to pick one of the periods\nwhen market was in a bull market phase.

But the S&P also fell\n20 percent or more, defined as a bear market, 25 times over that same period.\nTiming counts.\nIn other words, to buy and hold securities for a long period of time is a well-\ndocumented path to accumulating capital, but only if you got in at the best time.\nOtherwise, buy-and-hold is a path to the poorhouse. Consider the following:\n» If you had bought U.S. stocks at the price peak just ahead of the 1929 crash, it\nwould’ve taken you more than 20 years to recover your initial capital.\n» Since the end of World War II, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen by\nmore than 20 percent on 14 occasions.\n» From January 2000 to October 2002, the S&P 500 fell by 50 percent.

Ask yourself how often anyone makes a 100 percent return on\ninvestment.\n» During the Crash of 2018, the S&P fell 6.2 percent and the Dow 5.6 percent,\nthe worst performance in a decade — during a year that saw the highest\neconomic growth in a decade.\nThat covers the factual aspect of buy-and-hold — you need to get lucky in your\nentry. Now consider the underlying assumption that all information is already\nincorporated into the price, the so-called efficient markets hypothesis. Even in the\n“weak” form of the argument, the assumption is patently untrue.\nFor one thing, if markets were actually efficient, you shouldn’t get bubbles and\ncrashes, and yet undeniably they happen. Behavioral economists have found that\nprices are influenced by all kinds of bias, including overconfidence, wishful think-\ning, and the whole panoply of possible errors in both reasoning and in evaluating\ninformation that’s not always unambiguous.\nCan you beat the market using timing over buy-and-hold? Yes. Timer Digest\nhas tracked dozens of timers in gold, bonds, and equities who publish newslet-\nters over the past 35 years (www.timerdigest.com). In 2018 alone, the S&P\nex-dividends fell 6.24 percent. The top ten timers had gains ranging from\n12.86 percent to 40.32 percent. Over the past ten years, the S&P rose a cumulative\n177 percent.

You see the same names over and over again.\nThe emphasis in technical analysis is to make profits from trading, not to consider\nowning a security as some kind of savings vehicle. In buy-and-hold investing, you\nhardly ever sell, sometimes waiting until you have a catastrophic loss. In technical\ntrading, when you sell is just as important as when you buy.\nBefore diving into technical analysis, first you have to appreciate that it’s the\nchart that determines the trading decision, not the underlying fundamentals of\nthe security. You don’t have to follow earnings, management style, new inven-\ntions and designs, or any other qualitative aspect of an equity security.

They can be com-\nbined to complement one another.\nRecognizing Who Uses Technical Analysis\nBoth traders and investors use technical analysis. So what’s the difference between\na trader and an investor? Most people consider that a trader is someone who holds\nsecurities for only a short period of time, anywhere from a minute to a year. An\ninvestor is someone who holds securities from many months to forever. You may\nalso think of an investor as someone who seeks income from dividends or bond\ncoupon payments.\nActually, the dividing line between trader and investor isn’t fixed except for\npurposes of taxation. Be careful not to fall into the semantic trap of thinking that\na trader is a wild-eyed speculator while an investor is a respectable guy in a\npinstriped suit. I use the word trader in this book, but don’t let it distract you.\nPeople who consider themselves investors use technical methods, too.\nYou can use technical methods over any investment horizon, including the long\nterm. If you’re an expert in Blue Widget stock, for example, you can use technical\nanalysis to add to your holdings when the price is relatively low, take some partial\nprofit when the price is relatively high, and dump it all when it falls more than you\ncan stomach, only to buy it back when it bottoms.",

You can also use technical tools to rotate your\ncapital among several securities, allocating more capital to the ones delivering the\nhighest gains or the lowest risk. At the other end of the holding period spectrum,\nyou can use technical analysis to spot a high-probability trade and execute the\npurchase and sale in one hour.\nRemembering the Trend Is Your Friend\nYou can look at most charts and see that securities prices tend to move in trends,\nand trends often persist for long periods of time. Opinion varies as to how long\nany specific security remains in trending mode. It may be 20 percent or it may be\n80 percent. A trend is a discernible directional bias in the price — upwards, down-\nwards, or sideways. Many people don’t consider sideways a trend in its own right,\nbut rather a departure from an upward or downward direction.\nCHAPTER 1 Introducing Technical Analysis 13",

You gain\nan edge when you can forecast a change in direction, even if you don’t know yet\nwhich way. The secret to successful trading is to buy at a low price and sell at a\nhigher price. The chart displays lows and highs, and your charting work should\nindicate where you can next buy low and sell high.\nIn these sections, I show a model for identifying trendedness and how technical\nanalysts use the model to make money.\nCharting your path\nThe price chart is the primary workspace of technical analysis. Many technical\nanalysts work only with mathematical manipulation of prices in order to devise\nprobabilistically optimum trades, but the chart is the starting point for nearly\neveryone and remains the main workspace for the majority. Figure 1-1 shows a\nclassic uptrend following a downtrend.\nFIGURE 1-1:\nUptrend and\ndowntrend.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nAt the most basic level, your goal as a technical trader is to sit on your hands while\nthe security is falling and wait to identify the reversal point — the best place to buy\n(shown in the circle) — as early as possible. Figure 1-1 is a good example of the\nkind of chart with which you’ll spend most of your time. Unfortunately, most\ncharts aren’t as clear-cut as to the correct trading decision as this one.\n14 PART 1 Getting Started with Technical Analysis",

Unfortunately, most\ncharts aren’t as clear-cut as to the correct trading decision as this one.\n14 PART 1 Getting Started with Technical Analysis\n\n[Page 31]\nTrendiness versus trendedness\nTo say that something is on a trend is to say that it’s moving in a specific direction\nand exhibits evidence of a tendency to continue in that same direction. The use of\nsocial media like Twitter and Facebook is a trend. What’s the difference between\ntrendiness and trendedness?\n» Trendiness implies a fashion or fad that may wither and blow away, like\nskinny jeans.\n» Trendedness refers to a measurable directional bias. It’s a more serious word\nreflecting a more serious and enduring phenomenon.\nSkinny jeans may be out of fashion 30 years from now, but social media will prob-\nably still be around and securities charts will still be exhibiting price trendedness.\nBECOMING A QUANT\nYou don’t need to know any math at all in order to use technical analysis. If the word\n“algorithm” makes you feel faint, fear not. It’s enough to know the difference between\nbig and small, up and down, black and white.\nMath is a shorthand method of expressing what nonmath types (me included) put\ninto words. For example, I may say, “The price is moving upward at a faster pace than\nbefore.” The math person measures the exact extent of the upmove in arithmetic terms\nsuch as momentum. He takes today’s price and divides it by the price times number of\ndays ago. He does this for five days in a row and gets a momentum indicator that is a\nhigher number every day.",

Just because the math person has a number doesn’t make his\ntrading decision any better than yours without the number — the observation of the\nprice event is equally valid however you express it.\nYou can use indicators that you put on the chart yourself from your charting program,\nbroker platform, or website that lets you fool around with their indicators — without\nknowing or caring about the math behind the indicator. Your job as a student of techni-\ncal analysis is not to know exactly how an indicator is calculated arithmetically. It’s to\nknow what the indicator is indicating and what decision the indicator is suggesting\nto you.\nDon’t worry about finding a user-friendly program to do the math work for you.

In fact, don’t rush. You may\nfancy yourself a conservative person who would never want to join the ranks of\nthose flibberty-gibbet day traders, but the fact remains that day trading is a deeply\nrisk-averse form of trading when properly executed. And your position on life’s\ntimescale can be important, too. You can’t day trade when you have a day job, but\nyou can when you’ve retired or are temporarily out of work. I know of one auto\ncompany president (yes, president) who got through a rough patch (meaning\nunemployed) by day trading.\nComplicating your decision about what time frame to trade is the weird and\nwonderful aspect of market prices named their fractal property. Fractal refers to\nthe odd fact that a price chart of a security on a one-hour time frame basis can’t\nbe told apart from the price chart on a four-hour time frame or daily time frame\nor even weekly. If the chart isn’t labeled along the bottom horizontal x-axis to\ndisclose its period, you can analyze it using any indicator and get the same\noutcome as you would get on any other time frame.\nViewing the Scope of Technical Analysis\nTechnical analysis focuses on prices and often on the accompanying volume.\nAnalyzing prices can take many different forms — from drawing lines on a chart\nby hand to using high-powered computer software to calculate the most likely\npath of a price out of all possible paths.",

Some technical analysts reject the term charting because it\nharkens back to the days of colored pencils and rulers. They see charting as sub-\njective, whereas statistics-based indicators (which I cover in Part 5) are objective.\nBut many traders use charting conventions developed over decades because they\nwork.\nMarket timing\nMarket timing is another term used in place of technical analysis. All technical trad-\ning involves timing, but this term refers to statistical analysis that goes beyond a\nsingle chart. It encompasses many techniques, such as sentiment indicators and\ncalendar effects, that many self-described chartists say aren’t charting, and at\nleast some technical analysts say aren’t technical analysis. I cover these and other\ntools in Chapter 3.\nTrend-following\nThe very first question to ask when you look at any chart is, “Is the price trend-\ning?” Because so much emphasis is put on the presence or absence of a trend,\ntechnical analysis is sometimes named trend-following. Parts 4 and 5 contain\ntechniques that are trend-following. Some analysts object to the term because you\naren’t always following, but often anticipating, a trend such as when you use\nmomentum indicators (see Chapter 13).\nTechnical analysis\nTechnical analysis is the broadest of the terms. It’s a term encompassing all tech-\nniques, but at heart technical analysis seeks to measure and quantify market\nsentiment.\nTechnical analysis isn’t confined to just math-based techniques, as some folks\nmay think. Using math is a breakthrough and a curse. Math may outperform\nhuman judgment and the human eye, as many an optical illusion has proved, but\nit’s not true that numbers never lie. Numbers lie all the time in price analysis. You\ncan have a textbook-perfect trend with ten confirming indicators, and it can still\nrun into a brick wall — really bad news that trashes the price of the security over-\nnight. Math can never overcome the inconvenient fact that a Shock, which no one\ncan predict, may overwhelm any price trend. Shocks in capital letters are events\nlike 9/11.\nCHAPTER 1 Introducing Technical Analysis 17",

Don’t forget that behind the numbers are other human beings who\noften behave in irrational ways. Technical analysis (so far) remains an art, not a\nscience, even when it uses scientific methods.\nAlgorithmic trading\nAlgorithmic trading, also referred to as algo trading, uses a specific set of conditions,\nincluding technical analysis indicators, to trigger a trade. After the computer\nidentifies that all conditions are met, it automatically sends the trading order to\nthe broker. Computer programs are faster than human brains or fingers, so order-\ning a trade as quickly as possible is one of the benefits of algo trading. Some algo\ntrading companies pay for data collection sites a few seconds closer to the physical\nlocation of exchange data. Conditions can include time of day, volume, and other\nparameters as well as nuts-and-bolts technical analysis indicators. Algo trading,\nlike technical analysis, removes emotion from the trading decision.\nIf you’re a beginner in technical analysis, you won’t much care about algo trading,\nbut you should have at least an outline of what it is in order to know the lingo and\nbe able to judge commentary and promotions.",

As in all\ntechnical analysis, the design relies upon present price behavior repeating past\nprice behavior.

When the model identifies the end of the price\nmove, the algo system will dump all the slices, all at once.\nNoting the benefits of algo trading\nThe primary benefits of algo trading are as follows:\n» It takes human decision-making out of the immediate trading decision.\n» It’s much faster. The computer can do in nanoseconds what takes the normal\nperson at least a minute or two.\nMuch algo trading is high frequency trading (HFT), meaning in and out again in\nseconds. This is “trading without emotion” in spades!\nThe predecessor of algo trading was HFT, which is now a feature of algo trading,\ntoo. HFT is based on the high speed of computerized trading. The value comes\nfrom being able to get in and out of a trade very, very fast, and generally with a\nlarge number of trades and small gains or losses per trade. You wouldn’t buy and\nsell a stock for a one penny profit, but if you’re doing it with $1 million and doing\nit dozens of times per day, if you get it right, you’ll make hundreds of thousands.\nRocketing to the moon\nWhat is the difference between algo trading and a robot?

The essence lies in the computer pro-\ngram being able to modify some aspects of its performance using feedback. Say you\nhave a system that always buys a security when its price has fallen by x percent, based\non the observation that an x percent drop is the most probable norm for a bottom over\nmany instances in the price history. But now market volatility is higher — prices change\ndirection faster and after lesser moves. The program records these lesser moves and,\nwithout human judgment, alters the buy rule to (say) 15 percent. At the minimum, AI\nmakes a technical trading system more adaptive and does it far more quickly than a\nhuman can do.\nThe fancier AI story would be when the machine can observe dozens of nonprice\nfactors, such as the overall index to which the security belongs, economic data, or\nnews events like central bank policy changes, and can simulate the price change in this\none security in a flurry of mock trials — in nanoseconds. It calculates the probability of\neach of those events and all combination of those events as a price influencer. As the\nactual information becomes available, like an economic data release, the program starts\nall over again with the new information and its now-known effect. This effect becomes\nan input in the next round of mock trials.",

It’s possible\nthat some fund managers are already there, or close to it. More than one big-shot fund\nmanager has designed algo systems to mirror his own thinking in a way that is mathe-\nmatically expressible and thus programmable, but going beyond technical analysis.

A computer program can beat a human at chess, but it\ncan’t invent chess in the first place. The point is that while employing technical analysis\nqualifies you as a quant, not all quants are technical analysts.\nWhy Technical Analysis Works\nand What Can Go Wrong\nTechnical analysis works because humans behave in repetitive ways in response\nto the same stimulus. Everyone jumps back and yells “ouch” when their hand\ntouches too-hot water. People did that in 1000 BC, and they do it today.\nIn measuring market sentiment, history repeats. The traders facing the 1989 stock\nmarket crash and the 2018 crash reacted exactly the same way as the traders in the\n1929 stock market crash; in all cases, market players exhibited both flight and\nfight, the classic response to a fearful event. Granted, technical analysis uses sci-\nentific measurement to measure an unscientific object, the market. Human\nbehavior repeats, but not in as precise a known range as actual hard objects like\nmetal or water.\nMany indicators contain an implicit instruction as what to do — buy or sell the\nsecurity — but no indicator will tell you how much money to place in this single\ntrade or what to do if your indicator and therefore your forecast is wrong. Yes,\nindicators have a high probability of being right, but high isn’t 100 percent cer-\ntainty. That means there is some risk of loss when indicators are wrong.",

Some technical analysts have good indicators but fail to manage\nrisk properly, meaning in line with the amount of capital they have and how much\nloss they can tolerate psychologically and financially. All securities trading entails\ntaking losses, and technical analysis is no exception.

Exactly the opposite is true. Because you always know ahead\nof time where you’ll sell, you always know your gain or loss before you buy. So, for\nexample, to conduct a one-hour trade is inherently less risky than buying and\nholding a security indefinitely without an exit plan. The existence of an exit plan\nis what defines and limits the risk. Where does the exit plan come from? The indi-\ncators you choose — and you choose indicators based in part on how much gain\nand loss they are likely to entail in real-time trading. You can also choose your exit\nbased on dollar amounts, either the hard number ($200 and not penny more) or\nas percentage of capital stake per trade. Or you can mix methods, always exiting a\nposition if the loss is $200, but letting gains accumulate until an indicator tells\nyou the party is over.\nThe one-hour trade entails risk management, whereas holding a security without\nan end in mind on some concept of hypothetical “value” is to take 100 percent\nrisk.

Although you can’t know the\noutcome of any trade with 100 percent certainty, you can know with 100 percent\ncertainty how much you could lose. That’s because you’ll set a worst-case loss\nlimit at the same time you order the purchase.

Next, an outcome of crowd behavior is the tendency\nof prices to cluster around the average, even when the average is trending.

You’ll buy more ice cream if the price falls from $5 to 50 cents, but no price\nwill induce you to buy gallons and gallons of the stuff every week. People buy more\nwhen price falls, but with a limit. The same is true about price increases. If your\nbarber raises his price from $20 to $120, you’ll schedule fewer appointments. At\nsome price, like $250, if everyone has that price, you’ll demand no services at all.\nSupply is relatively fixed at any one point in time, but manufacturers and service\nproviders respond vigorously to price. Rising prices induce suppliers to make\nmore of the product or offer more of the service. Retired barbers come out of the\nwoodwork when the price of a cut goes to $250. New supply, whether of ice cream\nor barbers, forces the price back down, at least a little. The opposite is true, too.\nFalling prices send manufacturers and service providers out of business or into\ndifferent businesses that don’t have falling demand.\nThe constant shifting of prices as supply and demand adjust to one another is\nreferred to as price discovery — the price point where supply and demand meet. It’s\na constantly changing number. Price discovery is dynamic, which means it’s con-\nstantly adjusting to new conditions.\nSecurities prices behave in response to supply and demand like any other\ngood.",

When a tool company started using lithium batteries in handheld drills,\nrevolutionizing the drill business, another company quickly acquired it, and that\ncompany’s price nearly tripled the following year. Demand for the stock mirrored\ndemand for the product.\nAt any one time, securities traders have a good idea of the price range within\nwhich a security should trade — in the absence of a new factor like the lithium\nbattery example. In other words, they can estimate demand for the stock based on\na number of factors, including how the broad indices are behaving, economic\ngrowth or slowdown, and so on.\nAnd because humans just love to draw lines, traders define the normal, no-\nsurprises trading range with lines on a price chart. To start with, those lines are\nstraight lines. I discuss more dynamic (non-straight) lines in Chapter 12.\nThus was born support and resistance. Support can be described as the lower limit\nof a security’s price at which traders in this security think demand for the security\nwill re-emerge. If people were willing to buy the security at $10 on many other\noccasions, they should be willing to buy it at $10 again. At $10, the stock is cheap.\n30 PART 1 Getting Started with Technical Analysis",

The highest prices form resistance, meaning demand falls off as traders\nresist paying that high a price and existing holders sell to take profit, lowering the\nprice again.\nAgain, assuming no revolutionary discoveries (or the opposite, a product failure or\nmanagement scandal), I can draw an $8 trading range on the chart. Right away a\npair of lines on a chart is delivering guidance on the trading decision. In Figure 2-1,\nsee how the price falls back after hitting (and slightly surpassing) resistance at the\nhighs.

This section explains the reasons behind wild\nprice moves in securities prices like breakouts, spikes, and gaps (for breakouts, see\nbelow and for spikes and gaps, see Chapter 7). You don’t see breakouts, spikes, and\ngaps in the pricing for ordinary goods, but you’ll see them in securities prices. So,\nsometimes securities prices are set by plain old supply and demand as taught in\nEcon 101, and sometimes a different model is needed.\nSecurities aren’t socks: The demand effect\nSecurities are different from cars, bread, and socks. You don’t buy a security for\nthe joy of owning it and using it. You can’t drive it, eat it, wear it, or impress the\nneighbors with it. Aside from getting a dividend or coupon payment, the only rea-\nson to buy a security is to sell it again, preferably for more than you paid for it.\nUnless you’re a merchant, you never buy anything with the idea of selling it\nagain — except securities.\nIn an auction, what gets your blood running is that someone else also wants to buy\nthe item in question. Visible demand begets more demand. Auction economics are\ncontrary to what traditional economics teaches — that demand will decrease as the\n32 PART 1 Getting Started with Technical Analysis",

In the auction situation, demand increases as the price rises, some-\ntimes to ridiculous levels. The item may or may not be actually scarce in the real\nworld. It doesn’t matter.\nThe auction pricing process features momentum (which is why auctioneers talk so\nfast; refer to Chapter 13 for more on momentum). Auction prices change rapidly,\nunlike the pricing of cars, bread, and socks, which don’t change every few min-\nutes. The pace of the price discovery process influences the buyers by generating\nexcitement and even agitation. Excitement generates brain and other chemicals\n(such as dopamine and adrenaline) that actually promote more emotion and less\nreasoning.\nDemand rises as the price rises because the thing being auctioned looks progres-\nsively more valuable. If you like to visit eBay, you’ve seen demand for an object\nrise as the price rises. If you ever bought something on eBay, you probably paid\nmore for something than you should have. Every time someone else outbids you,\nyou want the item more than ever and become determined to be the winner. The\nintrinsic value of the item doesn’t matter.

The\nimmediacy of the auction is what skews prices, sometimes to absurd levels. Later,\nwhen suppliers see the high prices, they may indeed be able to find or produce\nmore of the item — but by then, the specific demand dynamic of that one auction\nis gone.\nShoving emotion to the back of your head is easier when market prices are\nslow-moving within an identified normal range than when a price makes a giant\nbreakout outside that range. Then you might become victim to mania — buy\nmore! buy more! — or panic — (sell all! sell all!). That’s why trading according to\nstrict technical rules as I outline in this book will save you from yourself.\nCreating demand from scratch\nWhen you’re wearing your trader hat, you buy a security solely because you think\nthe price will rise. You decide to sell because you have a profit that meets your\nneeds or because you’re taking a loss that is near intolerability. For-profit trading\nis purely opportunistic. You seldom think about the true supply of the security.\nTechnically, the supply of any security is limited by the number of shares\noutstanding and the like, but supply may be considered infinite for all practical\npurposes. For instance, at one point during the 2010s, the amount of oil in the\nworld was less than the amount of oil embedded in oil futures contracts. And con-\nsider your own situation. A price exists at which you can be induced to sell the\nstock for which you paid $10. It might be $20, or $200, or $10,000 — but rest\nassured, some price will force you to part with it, and right now.\nCHAPTER 2 Tapping into the Wisdom of the Crowd 33",

Similarly, the supply of a security dries up on rising prices, at least in\nthe short run. (Later, when the long-term security holder sees how high the price\nhas gone while he wasn’t looking, he may say “Holy Toledo!” and call his broker\nto sell, making more supply available.)\nIdentifying Crowd Behavior\nTechnical analysis is the art of identifying crowd behavior, also called the\nbandwagon effect, in order to join the crowd and take advantage of its momentum.\n(A subset of the bandwagon effect is named momentum investing, which I talk\nabout in Chapter 13). Crowd behavior is also referred to as the herd effect, a some-\nwhat insulting term considering that a herd stampedes when its leader spots a\nlion in the tall grass ahead and sends out a warning cry. In other words, it’s not\nsuch a bad thing to be a member of a herd.\nHere’s how a bandwagon works: A fresh piece of news comes out. Traders inter-\npret the news as favorable to the security, and a flood of bids allows sellers to raise\ntheir prices. You see the price going up and decide to join the crowd. Now the price\nhas surpassed the upside resistance line and by a lot. Your crowd is like a horse\nwith the bit in his teeth. It’s a form of mania.",

People become reckless and irra-\ntional in a mania.\nA mania is a situation in which traders buy an object or security without regard for\nits intrinsic value or even whether they’ll be able to sell it again later at a higher\nprice. They fear being left out of an opportunity. They’re caught up in the moment\nand temporarily irrational. A panic is the opposite — people can’t sell the thing\nfast enough and will accept ever-lower prices just to get any money back at all.\nThey become overly cautious after a bubble bursts.\nIn economic history, a mania or a panic comes along only a few times in a century.\nHowever, in securities markets, mania and panic happen far more often, if in\nminiature. Emotional extremes lead to price extremes in the context of the hour,\nday, or week — mini-manias and mini-panics occur all the time. Those words\naren’t used in technical trading lingo, but the emotion and the price effects are the\nsame as in big-picture manias and panics.\nIn the following sections, I discuss normal pricing that follows the conventional\nsupply/demand dynamics. When prices are moving normally, you can identify\nsupport and resistance and make note of minor excursions away from a central\naverage. A price that is moving calmly seems to be governed by rational players.\n34 PART 1 Getting Started with Technical Analysis",

I explain\nsome of the ways you can deal with those price changes later in this chapter.\nDefining Normal\nIn trading, the crowd that trades a specific security has a firm grip on the normal\ndaily high-low trading range and can quickly spot any big price move beyond that\nnormal range. (I cover the high and the low in Chapter 6 and the average range in\nChapter 7.)\nInstead of looking to the outer edges (support and resistance), one school of\nthought in trading holds that a minor break of support or resistance is a normal\nprice adjustment reflecting new conditions and nothing to freak out over. Instead\nlook to the center of the trading range, the norm or average, for guidance on how\nto trade. This section describes how to identify what is normal and outlines a\ntrading technique that some traders use. Alas, I have to throw in a few math terms,\nbut fear not. You can easily wrestle the concepts to the ground.\nReverting to the mean\nThe phrase reversion to the mean refers to a statistical concept that accepts as its\ncore assumption that high and low prices are temporary and a price will tend to go\nback to its average over time.

You\ncan observe that the price varies by about $5 every day around an average price of\n(let’s say) $20 over the past week. Therefore, if the current price is $17.50, that’s\nhalf of the normal trading range below the average price and a buying opportu-\nnity.

Prices are trended at\nleast some of the time, and so if the price is on a generally rising trend, expect to\nsee the distribution curve skewed to one side, toward the higher prices.\nTrading mean reversion\nTo trade the concept of mean reversion means that you find an average price over\nsome past period, figure out the high-low range, and simply buy when the price\nhas deviated to the low side of the range and sell when it gets to the high side.\nStudying reversion to the mean is useful and effective during periods when\nthe price is going sideways and not exhibiting a directional bias to the upside\nor downside, but can be useful in a trend, too, as long as you’re willing to adjust\nthe mean every so often. Does this sound too good to be true? Well, it is. Mean-\nreversion trading faces obstacles, such as:\n» The trading range can widen and narrow, like a pig in a python — with the\naverage daily range expanding and contracting. Your mean is still an anchor,\nbut what is the normal range? Suddenly you’re uncertain of the right place to\nbuy and sell.\n36 PART 1 Getting Started with Technical Analysis",

Say, for exam-\nple, that Blue Widget stock over the past two years averaged $20 — but that\n$20 average incorporates a few abnormal prices like $1 and $40. An average\ncan disguise multiple deviations that have already occurred.\n» Is it true that securities prices are normally distributed? Statisticians say that\nsecurities prices aren’t actually normally distributed — they just look that way\nsometimes. In technical analysis, your primary goal is to determine whether\nyour security exhibits a price trend. You also want to know how strong the\ntrend is and whether it may end soon. To accept the assumption that the\ndistribution of prices will be normal is the same thing as saying that you know\nin advance where the price trend will end — at or near the price represented\nby the average plus one standard deviation. If the price goes higher than the\nprice that one standard deviation dictates, the trading rule embedded in the\nmean-reversion trading technique would have you sell, perhaps right when a\ngigantic rally is starting.\nMean-reversion trading techniques are beguilingly tempting, but may involve\nmore risk than trend-following because you’re using a high number of assump-\ntions, many of which can be wrong.\nBreaking Normal\nFigures 2-1 and 2-2 illustrate support and resistance as measurements of supply\nand demand that is developing in a normal way.",

Demand gets disrupted, sometimes irrationally, and prices\nsoar or tank.\nThis disruption is called a breakout, and you never know whether it will persist and\nbecome a lasting uptrend (or downtrend as the case may be). Breakouts are a clear\nwarning sign that something happened to change market sentiment toward the\nsecurity and thus demand for it. Breakouts must always be respected, but\nbeware — they’re often false, meaning short-lived. No new trend emerges.

This is named positioning, and it can be a powerful\nfactor that moves prices substantially and seemingly without a reason.\nThere is a reason, but it’s confidential information kept secret by the big players.\nEach of the big players in every market has a position limit dictated by top manage-\nment. For example, the guy in charge of high-tech stocks at your pension fund\ncan invest no more than $500 million in that sector at any one time. Say the high-\ntech names have rallied substantially and now his position is $600 million. He has\nto sell $100 million, no matter what the chart or gurus say about likely gains still\nto come.\nPosition squaring is the closing of positions. Position squaring doesn’t necessarily\nimply that market participants think a move is over. They may plan to reenter the\nsecurity in the same direction later on.\nPosition squaring occurs for many reasons, including the following:\n» Traders think that the move is exhausted for the moment.\n» Traders have met a price objective — whether profit or loss.\n» Traders have met a time limit, such as the end of the day, week, month,\nor tax period.\n» Traders want to withdraw money from the security to trade a different\nsecurity, or for a nontrading purpose.",

Say,\nfor example, a high percentage of traders believe in a particular price-move\nscenario that then fails to develop in the expected way. A few traders throw in the\ntowel. The resulting lowering of the price causes bigger losses for the remaining\ntraders, and they, in turn, give up.

A retracement may also be termed a pullback or throwback.\nRetracements don’t really come out of the blue. Usually a retracement is a func-\ntion of traders seeing too much of a one-way street — all buyers and no sellers, or\nthe other way around. When a position is crowded, at some point prices just stops\nmoving. There is no fresh news to change market sentiment, just a kind of\ntemporary exhaustion.\nSometimes the price just stops and hovers in a narrow range around a particular\nlevel, but just as often the price moves in the opposite direction for a while as\ntraders take profits or cut losses as the case may be.\nRecognizing why retracements happen\nWhen the market runs out of cash, traders have to close positions to get their cash\nback so they can put on new trades. If they’ve been buyers, they need to sell. If\nthey’ve been sellers (shorting the security), they need to buy. Therefore, at the\nextreme outside limit of a price move, you should expect a temporary, minor\nreversal of the previous price move. In an uptrend, a retracement is always a drop\nin price.

In a downmove, when everyone who wanted to sell has\nalready sold, the security is called oversold. Several indicators help identify\nextended positions, including something frighteningly named a stochastic\noscillator, which I discuss more in Chapter 13.\nNotice that the terms overbought and oversold are applied to the security, but what\nthe terms secretly refer to is how much money the traders in that security have\navailable at the moment. By the time most of the market participants have jumped\non the bandwagon, they are tapped out. All their money is in a position.

An ordinary retracement caused by normal posi-\ntion squaring can suddenly turn into a full-fledged rout in the opposite direction\nif fresh news comes out that seems to support a reversal. Figure 2-3 shows a\nprimary trend with several retracements, each outlined by an ellipse.

This\nassumption isn’t accurate. If traders took profit on every correction, they’d all be\nrich. Remember, somebody bought at the high. If the correction goes too far\nagainst him, he must get out of the position at a loss. From this observation you\nshould deduce that to stick to a position when it’s correcting against you requires\nthe courage of your convictions — and capital.

To measure from the peak would be to say that traders make\ndecisions based on opportunity loss rather than cash loss, and although this\ncontains a germ of truth, it’s not a reliable assumption about crowd behavior.\n» Use magic numbers.

Your indicators are literally off the chart.\nIndicators like support and resistance work because of the law of large numbers.\nThis law states that when thousands or maybe millions of observations of a\nbreakout resulted in a reversal (say) 90 percent of the time, you should attribute a\n90 percent probability to the next breakout, too. The law of large numbers applies\nto all indicators, all the time, not just support and resistance.\nThat is, except when the market runs off the rails and the crowd goes to extremes.\nThis is the 10 percent of the time when market behavior isn’t hewing to its cus-\ntomary norms such as a price bouncing off support to the upside. At these times,\nacknowledge some of the strange characteristics of the crowd you have just joined\nby trading the same securities alongside it.

One behavior\nbegets another in a dynamic way. For example, many advisors recommend a rule\nthat if a price falls by x percent from a peak, it’s prudent to exit the trade. This is a\nmoney management rule rather than a technical one based on historical evidence.\nWilliam O’Neil of Investor’s Business Daily made the 8 percent rule popular. Famous\ninvestor Gerald Loeb and others used the 10 percent rule. Other advisors recom-\nmend a 25 percent rule.\nBecause these rules are so well known, many traders use them and cause the\nrule to be self-fulfilling. Traders know that others will exit at a level of (say) 8 to\n10 percent or 25 percent under the peak and will sell the security specifically to get\neveryone else to exit, whereupon they’re able to buy the security at a cheaper\nprice.

Dow observed that rising transportation stocks, chiefly railroads,\nreflected robust economic conditions, also called market fundamentals, even though\nthey’re actually economic fundamentals. When transportation stocks were rising,\nit was because sales and earnings were rising. The price of industrial company\nshares would follow for the same reason — rising earnings. The transportation\nstocks were thus a leading indicator of overall market sentiment.\nThe Dow Jones Company continues to track the transportation sector today in the\nform of the Dow Jones Transportation Average, although now it contains more\nthan railroad companies.",

Conversely,\nif market indicators point to an upmove but your security isn’t going along, you\nshould consider whether your security is exceptional and whether it’s worth\n“fighting the tape” (trading contrary to what market sentiment indicators are\nsaying).\nSentiment indicator may offer guidance when trendedness collapses into non-\ntrendedness or sideways, range-trading mode. This occurs during the confusing\ntransition phases between up and down, and also between up and higher, or\nbetween down and lower.\nSecurities aren’t always trending. Experts can’t agree on what proportion of the\ntime they are trending. The consensus seems to be that most securities are trended\nup or down about 30 to 40 percent of the time. The tendency for trends to collapse\ninto lack of visible, obvious trendedness is very pronounced.

For\nyour purposes, know that when the crowd is jumpy and nervous, it projects that\nanxiety into the future and assumes that prices will be abnormal.\nIn other words, the crowd believes volatility will be high. When the price of VIX is\nhigh, options traders have been buying puts and selling calls on the index —\nthey’re bearish and think the market may fall. What they really think is that the\nrisk of a fall is high and worth spending some insurance money on. When VIX is\nlow, the market is relaxed and confident — overly confident.\nVIX is generally used as a contrary indicator. When VIX is either abnormally high\nor abnormally low, you know it’s getting to the right time to trade against the\ncrowd.

The Cleveland index contains 16 indicators from all corners of the economy\nand financial sector, including bonds, real estate, currencies, and so on.

Six technical indicators are used, like how far the stock price\nis from the 200-day moving average. The S&P 500 is broken up into groups of\n50 stocks each, and thus you can see instantly whether your security is a leader or\na laggard in the context of its technical performance against a similar group, an\noriginal and advanced way of looking at market sentiment.

(Chapter 2 addresses\nthe concept of demand in greater detail.)\nVolume is the term for the number of shares or contracts of a security traded in a\nperiod. Volume is the most powerful confirming indicator of a price move, and\nconfirmation is a key concept in technical analysis. (See Chapter 16 for more on the\nconfirmation concept.) When you look at price changes, you imagine buyers\ndemanding more of the security at ever-higher prices or sellers offering a greater\nsupply at ever-lower prices. But a price can move on a single large purchase or\nsale, especially if the market happens not to have many participants at that exact\nmoment, a condition named illiquidity. (See Chapter 6 for a more-detailed descrip-\ntion of liquidity.)\nIn technical trading, you use volume to measure the extent of trader participation.\nWhen a price rise is accompanied by rising volume, you have confirmation that\nthe direction is associated with participation. Volume is outright, direct evidence\nof demand. Similarly, if you see a price fall by a large amount but the change isn’t\naccompanied by a proportional change in volume, you can deduce that the price\nchange was an aberration.

You calculate a midpoint as the high of the day plus the low of the day\ndivided by two. Chaikin’s version of accumulation and distribution is more refined\nthan OBV.\nIf a security closes above its daily midpoint, bullish sentiment ruled. The close\nover the midpoint defines accumulation, revealing that investors are buying shares.\nThe closer the closing price is to the high, the more bullish it was. If the price\nclosed right at the high, then you say that 100 percent of the volume can be\nattributed to bullish sentiment.\nConversely, distribution is the term for sellers willing to accept lower prices in\norder to induce buyers to buy. Lower prices imply bearish sentiment. Distribution\nis calculated the same way as accumulation — a close below the price midpoint\nmeans distribution. The closer the closing price is to the low, the more distribu-\ntion prevailed.

The first is based\nalmost entirely on “cognitive biases,” unconscious preconceptions that bypass\nrationality and shove a decision out the mental door quickly.\nIn this fast-thinking mode, humans give undue weight to information that is\nalready familiar, easily available, and memorable or vivid. For example, a trend-\nline running abnormally steeply and for an abnormally long time is very rare —\nthe trend must be nearing an end. An experienced trader may recognize from his\nthousands of hours of observation of previous long-running, steep trends that the\nprobability is high of a pending reversal. But it’s still jumping to a conclusion to\npredict a reversal without hard evidence. That doesn’t mean the experienced\ntrader is wrong. The long-running, steep trend may indeed be due for a reversal.\nBut the absence of evidence makes the trading decision to bet on a reversal an\nintuitive one, rather than a rational one.\nThe second, slow mode of thinking is supposedly the rational, take-your-time\nmode of decision-making. But it, too, often violates the assumption of maximiza-\ntion of self-interest. For example, experiment after experiment shows that avoid-\ning loss is a bigger preference than making a gain.",

The lines themselves are like a frame around a picture and you can’t\nsee outside the frame. You can’t avoid looking at how far away the current price is\nfrom support (in a falling price situation). In reality, outside the frame is a previ-\nous low that the current price trend may be targeting — your support line can be\neasily broken. Looking at only the immediate support line may be a form of con-\nfirmation bias — seeing what you expect to see. Consider the following:\n56 PART 1 Getting Started with Technical Analysis",

Confirmation bias has a dangerous side\neffect: You stop gathering information, especially information that might jolt\nyou out of the desired confirmation. Confirmation bias is probably the single\nbiggest shortcoming of the technical trader. The lines and indicators on your\nchart lead you to a deduction about where the price should go, and you forget\nthat other lines and indicators — or a chart on a different time frame — would\nlead you to a different conclusion and a different decision. Another form of\nconfirmation bias might be seeing that the overall market index is rising and\nthe market sentiment indicators described above are all in fine shape, and\nfailing to notice that your own specific security is circling the drain.\n» Another bit of bias is anchoring, where a person would rather retain some-\nthing for which the original price was high even as its price falls. Anchoring\naffects lookback periods in charting. When you paid $100 for a stock and now\nit’s priced at $50, you can’t help imagining it should be $100.

Contingencies are things that are possible but\nnot expected or not expected in any great number at the same time. You know\nwhat a contingency is — like hitting every red streetlight on the way to the train\nstation to catch the 6:09.

In\nstatistics, when you want to calculate the probability of two events happening\nsimultaneously (called joint probability), you multiply their probabilities. If you\nhave two remotely possible contingencies, each with a probability of 10 percent,\nthe chances of both happening simultaneously is 10 percent times 10 percent, or\n1 percent.\nReturning to the 75 percent chance Blue Widget will rise, assume a single 10 per-\ncent contingency. To calculate the effect of a 10 percent probability contingency\non your trade, you take the reciprocal of the probability, or 90 percent, as the\namount to modify the 75 percent. In arithmetic notation, it looks like this:\n75 percent 90 percent 67.50 percent\nIn other words, introducing just one contingency reduced the probability of your\noutcome from 75 percent to 67.5 percent. Wait, it gets worse. If you have four\ncontingencies and you attribute a 10 percent chance to each of them, the same\nprocess reduces your 75 percent odds to a mere 49.21 percent, which is less\nthan 50-50.\nJoint probabilities are a real bummer and are the real reason honest technical\ntraders hate to declare a forecast.

Scientists who do really\nserious science, like missiles and moon shots, demand a minimum of 200 cases.\nIn setting up the Blue Widget example in the preceding section, I attributed a\n75 percent chance of the price rising because three out of the last four times that\nconditions looked the same, that’s what happened. But a sample size of four\ninstances is hardly sufficient.\nYour price data seldom presents you with 30 identical cases, let alone 200. Why\nshould you accept less? The answer is that you’re using a technical analysis\nmethod that works across a wide range of securities and time frames, even if you\ndon’t have enough cases in this specific security.\nFor example, when you have a support line and your price breaks it to the down-\nside, that’s a sell signal. Over the past 100 years, technical analysts have used the\nbreak of a support line millions of times, and it worked in a majority of cases.\nUsing this method was the correct trading decision, although using the break of a\nsupport line as a signal doesn’t work every time. A support line break is an exam-\nple of a technical forecast that has a high probability in the context of many dif-\nferent contingencies and over many sets of conditions.\nOther techniques are less reliable. You may think it would be wonderful to have\na list of techniques with their reliability quotient, or a ranking of how often\nthey’re right. Some writers and software vendors claim that their techniques are\n“95 percent correct.” This lofty proclamation is never true. For one thing, the\nvendors aren’t considering new contingencies and conditions. Markets are\ndynamic.

Silver writes about polling data, including political polls,\neconomic forecasting, and business data like sales forecasting, but the principles\nare the same as for the predictive value of indicators. Data is data, and all data is\ndirty.\nIndicators are a substitute for that miraculous ability some few persons have of\nbeing able to get in sync with the market.

Leo Tolstoy, when answering the question “What is art?” said it’s\n“a means of union among men, joining them together in the same feelings.” This\nis exactly what you have, a form of union with other traders, when you are in\nZenlike harmony with the market.

Noise refers to\nprice changes that arise from unforeseen quarters, can’t be forecasted, and tend\nnot to last. The causes of noise vary from security to security and over time. Noise\nseldom changes a trend already in place, but it can mess with your indicators\nenough that you’ll get false signals.

An Event is generally more than just another bit of news in a series of\nnews — it’s a game-changer.\nDistinguishing between noise and an Event\nTo differentiate between noise and a genuine price Event, consider that in the\nforeign exchange market, you sometimes get a 1,000-point move in a single day\nwhen the average daily range is 120 points. A move of this magnitude isn’t noise\nbecause noise implies a minor price move with rapidly diminishing reverbera-\ntions. The 1,000-point shocker is an authentic price Event and almost always sig-\nnals a major change in trend (or starts a trend from a state of untrendedness). In\nequities, ordinary noise can be an earnings announcement that is different from\nthe earnings guidance the company or analysts told the market to expect ahead of\ntime. An Event would be an unexpected massive loss. In foreign exchange, ordi-\nnary noise is the release of the payrolls report. An Event is the United Kingdom\ndeciding by referendum to leave the European Union.\nNote that a barrage of noises, however, can become an Event even though no\nsingle component is more than noise. Famous economist Fischer Black said noise\nis when a large number of small events has a more powerful effect on prices than\na small number of large events. In other words, be wary of dismissing an inexpli-\ncable price move as “only noise.” Noise can rule the roost.",

You may still want to\ntry to distinguish between Events and noise, because Events change prices for\nsure, and with noise, you never know.\nOne useful clue that ordinary noise is actually an Event is to compare the news\nrelease with what had been expected by experts, which is named a surprise index\nand can be found in various formats. Comparing actual to expected takes you back\ninto the realm of fundamentals, but may give you an edge when you see prices on\nthe chart behaving abnormally.\nKnowing where noise comes from\nNoise arises from news and can be big or small. Big news includes a stunning\nreversal in an economic trend, a revolutionary product discovery, or a meaningful\nchange in sales and earnings from the previous guidance. Smaller news is a\nsmaller change in an economic trend, the appearance of a long-awaited product\ndevelopment (think Apple), or a minor change in sales and earnings. Some ana-\nlysts think noise is always external to the security whereas others think noise can\njust as easily be inherent in the security’s core conditions. An example is a change\nin a company’s dividend policy or a plan to execute buy-backs. Noise also comes\nfrom big market players changing positions, as a supply and demand factor (refer\nto Chapter 2) you may sometimes neglect to consider.\nCHAPTER 4 Gaining Critical Advantage from Indicators 63",

The interesting thing about market ripples is that markets adapt to them,\nand they stop being Shocks and become normal, losing their power to change\nprices.\nWhat’s the relationship of noise to randomness? A lot of what is considered noise\nisn’t really a surprise and not really unforecastable. For example, you get the U.S.\nnonfarm payrolls report on the first Friday of every month. You know it affects\nmany market prices disproportionately. What you don’t know is in what direction.\nOften you know payrolls will likely cause price spikes in both directions but the\nspikes aren’t forecastable as to extent or duration, let alone which direction comes\nfirst. The spikes are noise and certainly reflect Shock, but they aren’t random.\nSome noise, however, is truly random.

One subset of\nnoise traders are the high-frequency model-driven traders whose computers\nspew out thousands of bids and offers, virtually none of which get filled, trying to\nget a rise out of the unwary. Another subset of mischievous traders is named noise\ntraders by academic economists, a class that includes traders driven by ideology\nrather than information. Noise traders, also called uninformed traders, are often\ncontrarian, and academic studies find they tend to lose money in both noisy and\nnon-noisy market conditions.\nFrom the view of a single security, what the overall market is doing is an external\nfactor. But as Chapter 3 shows, as much as 25 percent of a price move in a specific\nsecurity may be due to the effect of changes in the index or class of securities to\nwhich it belongs. The fundamentals that move the index may or may not affect the\nsecurity, but it gets saddled with the effect anyway.\nA nontrending price series is especially vulnerable to random inputs that move the\nprice disproportionately to what rational analysis would say real cause-and-effect\nought to be.

The purpose of indicators is to clarify and enhance your\nperception of the price move.\nEvery trader wants to buy low and sell high. You use indicators to gain an edge\nin doing exactly that.

So indicators identify five condi-\ntions; note that in this list, I put some suggestions next to each condition, but\nsomeone else could name other, equally valid, indicators:\n» A trend is beginning (moving average crossover or pattern breakout).\n» A trend is strong or weak (momentum, slope of linear regression).\n» A trend is retracing but will likely resume (relative strength index).\n» A trend is ending and may reverse (momentum, moving average crossover, or\npattern breakout).\n» A price is range-trading (slope of linear regression or moving average).\nEach indicator works best in one situation and less well in others.

Most traders use a fixed set of indicators and try to remember that\nIndicator 1 is pretty good at validating rising prices (like the moving average)\nwhile not so hot at identifying an impending reversal. For that they may prefer\nIndicator 2, the MACD. Traders don’t identify conditions and then apply an indi-\ncator; they leave the indicators on every chart and expect to remember how to\nrank reliability under changing conditions.\nChoosing your trading style\nIdentifying trendedness is always your first task. Ah, but which trend over what\ntime period? Take a good hard look at Figure 4-1, which depicts a downtrend that\nconsists of four legs down punctuated by four legs up. If you knew at the begin-\nning of this chart how it was going to look three months later, how many trades\nwould you take?\nFIGURE 4-1:\nCount the trends.\nThere’s no single right answer. If you sold at the first high and bought back on the\nlast bar, you’d have one outcome. Instead if you sold at every peak and bought at\nevery bottom for a total of eight trades, you’d have a different outcome. In fact,\nyour total gain would be higher than the one-trade version, assuming you could\nbuy at the lowest low and sell at each tippy-top (something you should never\nassume in technical analysis because it’s unrealistic).\nCalling the one-trade person a trend-follower and the eight-trade person a swing\ntrader has gone out of fashion. In practice, both are trading trends — they just\nhave different durations. Both trading styles may or may not entail going short.\nTo go short is to sell a security you don’t actually own — you borrow it from some-\none else through your broker — with the intent to buy it back more cheaply. If the\nsecurity is priced at $10 and your indicators tell you it’s likely to fall to $5, that\n$5 gain from the short trade is just as green as the gain you get from the long\ntrade, that is, buying at $5 and selling at $10.\nCHAPTER 4 Gaining Critical Advantage from Indicators 67",

In\nequities, getting broker permission to go short can be hard (and expensive) for\nmost traders. Most retail equity traders can go in only one direction — long. They\ncan buy, but they can’t go short. This removes half of the trading opportunities\nyour indicators will deliver, and when you get to the point of backtesting your indi-\ncators, you need to specify whether you can trade in both directions. If Figure 4-1\nrepresents your security and you can only buy, you have four trades.\nWhich type of trader are you, the longer term or the shorter term? If you’re a\nbeginner, don’t decide just yet.

Chances are good doing so could end up becom-\ning confusing, but there’s nothing wrong with it in theory.\nFADING THE TREND\nPrices often move two steps forward and one step back. Sometimes you see a pause\nin an uptrend arriving, and you know that early buyers are about to take profit, setting\noff a domino effect of falling prices. You know that the uptrend is well established, but\ninstead of waiting for the trend to end, you sell your position and also go short today\nwith the intention of exploiting just this one small downmove retracement. Selling\ninto an uptrend sounds counterintuitive. But in practice, retracements are fairly relia-\nble. Trading the retracement is called fading the trend, and it is standard operating\nprocedure, especially in futures. Fading the trend works best if the countertrend\ntrade is very short term (such as hours or days).\nWhen you fade the trend, you break a cardinal rule of technical trading — to trade\nwith the trend, which is based on the Dow principle that once a trend is established,\nthe probability is high that it will continue. Therefore, to fade the trend is a purely\nopportunistic action based on an understanding of crowd psychology. Fading the\ntrend also illustrates that the frame of reference of technical trading isn’t the security\nand its fundamentals, but crowd behavior. Just remember, swing trading against the\ntrend requires lightning speed, total concentration, and nerves of steel.\n68 PART 1 Getting Started with Technical Analysis",

Figure 4-1 shows four downward moves.\nWhether you can sit them out is a function of personal patience combined with\nconfidence in your indicators.\nExamining How Indicators Work\nIndicators can’t be easily categorized as belonging to trend trading or to swing\ntrading, although it’s obvious that if you’re using a long-term moving average\nlike the 50-day (see Chapter 12), it won’t be appropriate to a shorter-term swing\ntrade on a daily chart.\nThat doesn’t mean you can’t use a 50-period (or a 200-period) moving average on\nan intraday chart. In intraday analysis, the period isn’t a day, but some number of\nminutes. For example, the 240-minute bar (4 hours) is popular in foreign\nexchange. That makes the 50-period moving average consist of 8.33 days, fairly\nlong-term when your analysis window is 4 hours and your holding period is 24\nto 48 hours. Likewise, a 200-period moving average is 33.33 days, which in swing\ntrading is definitely a long-term period. In the sections that follow, I describe the\ngeneral way indicators work, but be aware that technical traders are sometimes\nmavericks and use indicators in an infinite variety of ways.\nFinding relevant time frames\nMost indicators measure price and volume changes relative to previous prices and\nvolume over a specific lookback period, such as 12 days or 21 days.\nMost indicators have a range of time in which research shows they work best.",

A default parameter is only a starting point, and if 12 periods doesn’t work\non your chart, you’re welcome to use a different number of periods. Twelve peri-\nods is the default because researchers found it the best number over many thou-\nsands of price series. Be sure to differentiate between the lookback period, such as\nthe number of days of past data you’re putting in the indicator, and your trading\nfrequency. Using a 12-day momentum indicator, say, doesn’t mean you’ll trade\nevery 12 days. It means simply that for this security, a 12-day lookback period was\neffective. Most indicators and patterns can stretch from a few minutes to several\ndays or even many months, with a few exceptions. You wouldn’t use momentum,\nfor example, on a monthly chart, but you could use it on weekly and more frequent\nintervals. Support and resistance lines can be drawn on a chart of any time frame,\nand you can often see patterns like head-and-shoulders on 60-minute bars as\nwell as a chart containing a year of data.

Many traders just leave the\ndefault parameters of their indicators in their chart-drawing system and use them\non every time frame.\nThe ability to apply an indicator over any time frame reflects the fractal quality of\nprices — the weird and wonderful fact that without a label, a price series of\n15-minute bars can’t be distinguished from a month’s worth of daily bars. Intra-\nday bars are like microcosms of daily bars, and daily bars are like microcosms of\nweekly or monthly bars. Traders respond to price changes in regular, consistent,\nand repetitive ways no matter the time frame.\nYou should discard the idea that you already know your time frame. You may think\nyou’re a long-term trader but then discover a real affinity for an indicator that\nworks stunningly on your favorite securities but entails trading 10 to 20 times per\nyear when you started thinking you would trade twice a year at most.

They include\n» The price crossing a fixed historic benchmark: (See the “Establishing\nBenchmark Levels” section later in this chapter.)\n» The indicator crossing the price or the price crossing the indicator: (See\nChapter 10 for support and resistance and Chapter 12 for moving averages.)\n» One line of a two-line indicator crossing the other: (See information on the\nmoving average convergence/divergence indicator in Chapter 13.)\nIn most instances, the price crossing an indicator is named a breakout, one of the\nmost important concepts in technical analysis.

Usually, you want to scrupulously observe and measure a breakout.\nIf the resistance line is at 10 and the price goes to 12, it’s a breakout. If the price\ngoes to 10.05, it’s also a breakout.\nThe word breakout itself tells you the crowd psychology behind the price move. In\nan upside breakout, bullish sentiment triumphed. The bulls broke out of the\nenclosure and are cavorting in the pasture. When bearish sentiment wins, the\nbears have broken down the fence and are eating your prize roses. A breakout\ndoesn’t necessarily imply a trend reversal, though; sometimes a breakout is a\nconfirming factor that the existing trend is gathering new momentum or passing\nnew benchmarks.\nRange limits\nOscillators describe where today’s price stands relative to its recent trading range,\nas I describe in Chapter 13. Oscillators are usually based on 100, so they range\nfrom zero to 100, or minus 100 to plus 100, or some other variation using the\nnumber 100.\nIn practice, traders find that usually the scope of the price range falls well under\nthe outer limits and doesn’t vary by more than 20 percent to 80 percent of the\ntotal possible range, so they draw a line at 20 percent of the maximum range and\nanother at 80 percent (or 10 percent and 90 percent, or some other variation).\nWhen the indicator approaches one of the lines, the price is nearing an extreme of\nits recent range.",

This is a warning of an overbought or oversold condition and thus\na potential retracement or reversal.\nConvergence and divergence\nConvergence refers to two indicator lines coming closer to one another, such as\nwhen a support line and a resistance line converge to form a triangle (see\nChapter 9) or two moving averages get closer together (see Chapter 13), indicating\nless difference between their numerical values. Convergence generally means that\nthe price action is starting to go sideways or has a narrower high-low range, or\nboth. A sideways move, in turn, generally leads to a breakout, although it can take\na painfully long time. Convergence doesn’t have an embedded trading rule and is\nmore often used as a warning that a change in direction or the strength of a trend\nis changing.\nDivergence refers to two indicator lines moving farther apart, such as when the\nspread between two moving averages widens. Divergence also refers to an indica-\ntor and the price going in different directions, which is the most common and\nuseful application of the observation. Momentum indicators, in particular, reshuf-\nfle the components of the price bar to come up with a price’s rate of change, so\nthat the slope of the indicator is a sophisticated measure of the strength of a trend.\nCHAPTER 4 Gaining Critical Advantage from Indicators 71",

This divergence is almost always a warning that the rising price is\ngoing to stop rising sometime very soon.\nDivergence is one of the few leading indicators in technical analysis and some-\nthing you should note as a warning of a possible trend change, although it, like\nconvergence, doesn’t have an embedded trading rule. Volume is a notable instance\nof divergence that assists tremendously in making a trading decision. Chapter 3\ndiscusses volume in greater detail.\nEstablishing Benchmark Levels\nSome price chart characteristics are inherent to the chart and independent of your\nindicators. Every price series has historic highs and lows that aren’t indicators,\nand yet they may serve to indicate future price action, like the 52-week high or\nall-time high (or low). In some instances, years can pass before the benchmark is\nmatched again. Historic levels are magnetic — they attract some traders to try to\nbreak them — but they’re also barriers.

If an\nuptrending indicator like the moving average flattens mysteriously, widen the\ntime frame on your chart to see whether the price is near a historic level. The\nmarket is going to test the old high. If the test fails, expect a retracement and\nmaybe a reversal.

Indicators and trading rules have a\nchicken-and-egg relationship. The process of selecting and using indicators\ninvolves not only the characteristics of the indicator, but also a consideration of\nthe trading rules you must employ to make the indicator work properly for you.\nFor example, you may like an indicator but find it generates too many trades in a\nfixed period, so you don’t execute every single signal.

That’s a total of four more criteria you need to measure in\nyour backtest to choose the best parameters.\nCHAPTER 4 Gaining Critical Advantage from Indicators 75\n\n[Page 92]\nBacktesting never delivers a single, no-brainer parameter. Even after factoring in\nbrokerage and slippage costs, you still have to choose between the parameter that\ncalls for more trades over one that calls for fewer trades, between one that delivers\nmore winning trades than losing trades, and the one that delivers a better win-\nloss ratio. You hardly ever find a parameter for your indicator that meets all the\ncriteria. A compromise is in your future.\nFixing the indicator\nAssume that percent gain is your priority. What comes second? Most people choose\nreducing the number of losing trades, which is the correct choice. The single best\nway to reduce your losing trades is to add a confirmation requirement, such as one\nof the momentum or relative strength indicators. Requiring a second indicator to\nconfirm a buy/sell signal will reduce the number of trades by 30 to 50 percent with-\nout sacrificing much profit. And because the trades being eliminated by momentum\nconfirmation are generally losing trades, the gain-loss ratio improves, too.\nAfter choosing your indicator parameter, your job isn’t finished. Backtests are\nhypothetical. You didn’t actually make those trades. To get a more realistic idea of\nhow an indicator-based trading rule works, backtest the rule on historical price\ndata and then apply it to out-of-sample data. In the case in Table 4-1, for example,\nI backtested on 1,000 days of data. Now I should backtest it on the next 500 days\nof data, named a walk-forward test.",

Although it’s accurate,\nit’s not terribly useful. Critics of backtesting point out that even if your indicator\nis robust on the next 500 days of out-of-sample data, after you actually add that\n500 days to the backtest, the perfect parameter is now some other number. You\ncan go mad backtesting until you’re blue in the face, and you’ll never find the\noptimum parameter that stays the same over time.\nThe unreliability factor gets worse if you fiddle with the indicator with filters.

I recommend backtesting anyway because it’s a tre-\nmendously educational experience. You discover not only about the inner work-\nings of indicators, but also about yourself and your own risk preferences. For\nexample, you may start out thinking you care most about total percent gain and\nare willing to disregard big losses as long as you get a high gain in the end. But\nwhen you see that a favored indicator can cost you 20 percent of your capital stake\nseveral times a year, you may suddenly start preferring a less aggressive indicator\nthat tends to cost you only 5 percent in each losing trade. Choosing indicators via\nbacktesting is a journey of self-discovery as well as a scientific exploration.\nBacktesting has fallen out of favor in recent years, probably because it’s a massive\namount of work that takes a vast amount of time and ideally should be refreshed\nrepeatedly. At a minimum you’re trying to get the best combination of percent\ngain, highest gain-to-loss ratio, more winning than losing trades, and an indica-\ntor that is robust across a range of conditions. That’s a tall order, and the trade-\noffs are sometimes peculiar. Adding additional indicators to get confirmation\nincreases the workload exponentially. If you’re computationally competent and\nclever with numbers, you can modify the parameters of multiple indicators to\ngenerate a trading system having exceptional profitability. While you’re doing\nthat, though, you’re not doing other things, like watching prices move to get a feel\nfor the rhythm of the market.

At the\nmost basic, a trading rule instructs you to buy or sell when an indicator meets a\npreset criterion (like the moving average crossover in the case in Chapter 4). Many\nindicators have a buy/sell trading rule already embedded in them, as I describe in\neach of the chapters about indicators.\nBut technical trading is a mindset that goes beyond using indicators. Trading rules\nimprove your trading performance by refining the buy/sell signals you get from\nindicators. Trading rules tend to be more complex and contain more conditions\nthan raw indicators, such as “buy after the first 45 minutes if x and y also occur”\nor “sell half the position when z occurs.”\nFinding your risk profile . . . not yet\nEvery trade you take needs to meet a simple goal: Your expectation of gain is\nhigher than your expectations of a loss. This is a fancy way of saying you want to\nget the highest return for the lowest risk. In this context, risk refers to the risk of\nloss. And that’s as far as you need to go right now in determining your own\npersonal risk profile. How much are you willing to lose in order to have the oppor-\ntunity to make how big a gain?

This\ntrade-off is more realistic in real-world conditions, but you have no way of know-\ning upfront if the indicators you come to like will deliver that win-loss ratio.\nIn a nutshell, you need to develop your indicators and your trading rules dynami-\ncally with constant feedback from one to the other in a process of self-discovery\nas to your risk profile. You don’t set your risk preferences first and then choose\nyour indicators. Risk preference emerges organically from the process of develop-\ning indicators and trading rules.

Most technical analysts consider each buy/\nsell situation as a stand-alone case.

As in every\nuptrend, it corrects downward from time to time, exactly as Edwards and\nMagee described decades ago. You want to take profit at the first sign of a\npullback and reenter at a relative low (refer to Chapter 4). You want to be the\nswing trader who takes the eight trades in the overall move, or four if you’re\nunable to take the short side. You already know the security is trending. Your\nreentry rules are inherently different from entering from scratch and will most\nlikely involve additional indicators.\nThe technical trader plans the trade from entry to exit.

Unfortu-\nnately, few experts offer guidance on how to design a take-profit rule. You never\nknow at the beginning of a trend how long it will last or how far it will go. The\ncentral issue in managing the trade is that you can have control over the size of\nyour losses (via stop losses), but very little control over the size of the gains. You\ncan buy a stock at $5 and make sure that you only lose $2, but you can’t force the\nstock to go to $9.\nIn practice, each individual trader develops his own technique that is a combina-\ntion of risk analysis and indicator readings. The optimum way to take profit is, in\nfact, one of the great, unexplored frontiers of technical trading. Here are some\nchoices for selecting a profit target:\n» Name a dollar amount. Logically, you want a gain that is a multiple of the\nrisk you’re taking. Say your security costs $8 and you want to lose no more\nthan 25 percent, or $2. You can place your stop at $6 ($8 minus $2) or a\nsmaller amount, like $1.50. Your profit target is double initial risk, or $4. This\nis a 50 percent return, which may or may not be realistic depending on your\nholding period, changes in volatility, and other factors.

The problem with this approach, of course, is that the price may\nkeep on rising and then you have an opportunity loss if it reaches (say) $20.\n» Set a true-range amount. Your security, historically, has an average high-low\nrange of $10 over 20 periods, your expected holding period. You want to\ncapture 75 percent of the range, or $7.50. Because you use indicators to time\nyour entry, you assume that you’re entering at the low end of the range; there-\nfore, 75 percent is realistic. When the price reaches your target, you take profit.\nThe problem with this approach is twofold:\n• The range can widen or narrow. If it widens, you aimed too low, and if it\nnarrows, your original target is too ambitious.\n• A pullback can wreck your expectations. You may have met the goal of\nentering at a low only to have an aberrant pullback take the price down\n30 percent rather than up 75 percent. This movement wasn’t enough to hit\nyour stop, but now your profit target is $10.50 away from the current price.\nBecause you know the average range is $10, the probability of meeting\nyour $7.50 target within your holding period just went out the window.\n» Rely on indicators. Instead of formulating take-profit rules, most technical\ntraders rely on indicators to signal when a move has ended — the signal is the\nde facto take-profit rule.

You’re welcome to test the\nmeasured move concept on the price history of your securities and rank\nmeasured move as an indicator, just as you should rank your other indicators\nfor reliability.\nControlling Losses\nYour level of risk-seeking or risk-aversion is personal. Therefore, nobody can\ndesign rules for you. You must do it for yourself. Ask yourself whether you’d faith-\nfully follow every buy/sell signal of a given indicator when history suggests you’ll\nhave some trades that entail a loss of 50 percent. No? Well, how much of your\ntrading capital are you prepared to lose? This isn’t an idle question. Your answer\nis critical to whether you succeed in technical trading. If you say you can accept no\nlosses at all, forget technical trading. You will take losses in all trading, even\nwell-designed and planned technical trading. If you say that you’re willing to lose\n50 percent in a single trade — whoa, Nellie! That’s too much. Three or four losing\ntrades in a row and you wouldn’t have enough capital left to do any trades.

A stop-loss order is an order you give your\nbroker to exit a trade if it goes against you by some amount. For a buyer, the stop-\nloss order is a sell order below the current market price.

Don’t skip over\nthis section. More than likely it can save your bacon from a catastrophic loss.\nMental stops are hogwash\nYou should enter your stop-loss order at the same time you enter the position.

Another rationalization is that the trader’s stops get hit,\nand often, only for the price to move back in the original direction right afterward.\nThis excuse isn’t a reason to avoid using stop losses. It’s a reason to reset the stop\nto a better level.\nTo pretend that you have a mental stop or to refuse to place stops is to avoid\naccepting the reality of trading — it’s a business, and setbacks happen in busi-\nness. Setting a stop-loss order is like buying insurance in case the house burns\ndown. Not to take out insurance is to treat trading as a hobby and view the amount\nat stake as play money rather than as risk capital.\nSorting out the types of stops\nTechnical traders have developed many stop-loss principles. Each concept is\neither a fixed trading rule or a self-adjusting one. Stops relate to indicators, to\nmoney, or to time, and often these three don’t line up neatly to give you an easy\ndecision.

(To find out more about how\ncomplete amateurs were taught to trade successfully on trading rule discipline\nalone, check out The Way of the Turtle [McGraw-Hill] by Curtis Faith.) The 2 percent\nrule states that you should stop a loss when it reaches 2 percent of starting equity.\nIf you’re trading risk capital of $10,000, you can afford to lose no more than $200\non any single trade if you expect to stay in business for a long period of time. The\n2 percent rule is an example of a money stop, which names the amount of money\nyou’re willing to lose in a single trade.\nTwo hundred dollars may sound like a tiny number to you, but in the context of\nactive trading, this figure is quite large. You need only 50 losing trades in a row to\ngo broke. And 50 trades may sound like a lot of trades, but you find that many\nvalid indicators have you trading that often, depending on your time frame. If\nyou’re trading 15-minute or 60-minute bars, you could easily have more than 100\ntrades in a month. If you’re trading five securities, for example, you go broke after\nten consecutive losses per security.\nRisk-reward money stops\nThe risk-reward ratio puts the amount of expected gain in direct relationship to the\namount of expected loss. The higher the risk-reward ratio, the more desirable the\ntrade. Say, for example, that you’re buying Blue Widget stock at $5 and your indi-\ncators tell you that the potential gain is $10, which means that the stock could go\nto $15. You could set your initial stop at $2.50, or 50 percent of your capital stake,\nCHAPTER 5 Managing the Trade 89",

That gives you a risk-reward ratio of 10:2.5, or 4:1.\n(Strangely, the amount of the gain, the reward, is always placed first in the ratio,\neven though it comes second in the name.)\nBut consider the premise from this example — your ending capital triples your\ninitial stake. But gee, expecting a 300 percent return is going a bit far, isn’t it?\nWell, it depends on your skills. If you consistently forecast and get 300 percent\ngains, good for you. You may be able to accept a higher initial stop-loss level than\nother mere mortals.\nTo apply the risk-reward ratio in a conservative and prudent manner, turn it\nupside down. Instead of calculating it with your best-case expected gain, use a\nrealistic worst-case estimate of the loss. Your worst-case gain should be higher\nthan your worst-case loss. For example, say you’re prepared to lose $2 for the\nchance to make $4. Your risk-reward ratio is 4:2, or 2:1. If you practice this exer-\ncise on every trade, the risk-reward ratio becomes a filter that winnows out trades\nthat may be high probability but with excessive risk.\nCalculating the risk-reward ratio and using it to set a stop has its own dangers.

If\nyou buy more at $3.50 and the $15 is indeed reached, your gain is even bigger in\npercentage terms. Using the risk-reward ratio this way is how traders trick them-\nselves into adding to losing positions, the blackest of cardinal sins in trading.\nAnalyzing risk-reward ratios can quickly become a complex task requiring\nknowledge of statistics and probability. But you can take a stab at it using simple\narithmetic as in the examples in this chapter. Any estimation of risk-reward is\nbetter than none, and surprisingly, after it becomes second nature, your comfort\nlevel with trading will rise. The central idea is that in technical trading, the gen-\neral rule is to take small losses and aim for bigger gains, not to take big losses and\naim for gigantic gains.\nMaximum adverse excursion\nJohn Sweeney developed the concept of maximum adverse excursion, which is the\nstatistically determined worst-case loss that may occur during the course of your\ntrade. Using this method, you calculate the biggest change in the high-low range\nover a fixed period (say 30 days) that’s equivalent to your usual holding period.\nActually, you need to calculate the maximum range from the entry levels you\nwould’ve used. Because you know your entry rules, you can backtest to find the\nmaximum range that was prevalent at each entry.\n90 PART 1 Getting Started with Technical Analysis",

You should see a regular pattern between\nthe maximum adverse excursion and your winning and losing trades over time. In\nfact, you can use the inverse of the adverse excursion, the maximum favorable\nexcursion, to select trades in the first place. See Chapter 14 on volatility.\nTrailing stops\nTrailing stops use a dynamic process that follows the price: You raise the stop as the\ntrade makes profits. A trailing stop is set on a money basis — you maintain the\nloss you can tolerate at a constant dollar amount or percentage basis. You could,\nfor example, say that you want to keep 20 percent of each day’s gain, so every day\nyou’d raise the stop day to include 80 percent of the day’s gain. This method\nmeans calling the broker or reentering the stop electronically every day. The\nimportant point is to keep the stop updated to protect gains and guard against\nlosses at the same time.\nTrailing stops are highly protective, but you risk being stopped out on a noisy\nprice event that isn’t really related to the overall price trend, like calendar events\nor the payrolls report the first Friday of every month. The normal average daily\ntrading range encompasses the trailing stop level on most occasions, but you can\nstill get stopped out on a random event causing an abnormal, off-trend spike.\nIndicator-based stops\nIndicator-based stops depend on the price action and the indicators you use to cap-\nture it.",

Indicator stops can be either fixed or self-adjusting. I mention them at\nvarious places throughout the book. Here are some important ones:\n» Last-three-days rule: The most basic of stop-loss rules is to exit the position\nif the price surpasses the lowest low (or highest high if you’re going short) of\nthe preceding three days. This idea sounds a little corny. However, it jibes well\nwith another piece of trading lore that says a trade should turn profitable right\naway if you’ve done the analysis right and you’re actually buying right after a\nlow or selling right after a peak. If the price first rises for a day or two but can’t\nhold on to the gain, the upmove that you think you’ve identified is probably a\nfalse one. Consider the crowd dynamics (see Chapter 2) and how they play out\non the price bar (refer to Chapter 6). You need a series of higher highs and\nhigher lows to name an uptrend. If you get a lower low in the first three days,\nthe probability is good that the trade is going south.\n» Pattern stops: Pattern stops relate directly to market sentiment and are very\nhandy. Most are of the fixed variety. I list a few here:\n• The break of a support or resistance line is a powerful stop level, chiefly\nbecause so many other traders are drawing the same lines.\nCHAPTER 5 Managing the Trade 91",

When the confirmation point is surpassed,\nthe probability is high that the move will continue in the expected\ndirection. If you’re positioned the wrong way when the pattern\nappears, the pattern confirmation is also your stop level.\n» Moving-average stop: You can also use a separate indicator that isn’t\npart of your buy/sell repertoire to set a stop, such as a moving average\n(see Chapter 12). Many traders use a breakout beyond the 10-day moving\naverage as a warning to reduce a position and the 20-day moving average as\na stop. You may find it interesting how often a retracement will penetrate a\n10-day moving average but halt just short of crossing the 20-day moving\naverage. A moving-average stop is clearly of the self-adjusting variety.\nVolatility stops are the most complex of the indicator-based, self-adjusting stops\nto figure out and to apply, but they’re also the most in tune with market action.\nMany variations are available.

Here are three of particular interest:\n» Parabolic stop-and-reverse model: Invented by Welles Wilder, the parabolic\nconcept is easy to illustrate and hard to describe. The principle is to create an\nindicator that rises by a factor of the average true range (see Chapter 7) as\nnew highs are being recorded, so that the indicator accelerates as ever-higher\nhighs are met and decelerates as less-high highs come in. In an uptrend, the\nindicator is plotted just below the price line. It diverges from the price line in a\nhot rally and converges to the price line as the rally loses speed as in Figure 5-1.\nThe parabolic stop is both self-adjusting and trailing — a rare combination.\n» Average true-range stop: This stop is set just beyond the maximum nor-\nmal range limits. I describe the average true-range channel in greater detail\nin Chapter 14. With this stop, you take the average daily high-low range of\nthe price bars, adjusted for gaps, and expand it by adding on a constant,\nlike 25 percent of the range. Say your average daily trading range is $3. If\nthe price goes more than 25 percent beyond the $3 high-low range, you\nconsider it an extreme price and the signal to exit. The average true-range\nstop has the virtue of being self-adjusting, but it also has the drawback of\nsetting a stop that has nothing to do with your entry.\n» Chandelier exit: This stop solves the entry-level issue. Invented by Chuck\nLeBeau, the chandelier exit sets the stop at a level below the highest high\nor the highest close since your entry. You set the level as a function of the\naverage true range. The logic is that you’re willing to lose only one range\nworth (or two or three) from the best price that occurred since you put on the\ntrade.

By then, you figure that the move is well in\nplace. But remember, you have to have one stop-loss order on the first\ncontract and a different one on the second trade.\nApplying stops to adjusted positions\nIf you’re using an indicator stop and it signals that the price rise is over, doesn’t\nthat mean you want to exit all positions at the same level as soon as possible? The\nanswer from statisticians is maybe. It depends on whether you’re thinking in\nchart terms or money-management terms. If you’re using a breakout concept to\nset your stop, for example, the price crossing a support line (as in Chapter 10) is a\nsell signal that would apply equally to all positions.\nIf you’re using a 2 percent or other rule (like the chandelier exit I mention in this\nchapter) that is calculated specifically with reference to your starting point, you\nexit each trade according to the rule. This method has benefits and drawbacks.\nThe benefit is that you’re still in the trade if the stop was triggered for one trade\nbut the price retracement is only a minor, temporary one. You still have other\npositions left and if the price makes a big jump your way, you’re correctly posi-\ntioned to take advantage of it.",

Expectancy is a mathematical construct that can get very difficult\nvery fast if you let it. But the basic concept is easy enough: You add up the possible\noutcomes and average them.\nHere is an example. Pretend your indicator set would result in a 90 percent chance\nof a 50 percent gain and a 10 percent chance of a 100 percent gain. To put that in\na formula, it looks like this:\nExpected Return (0.10 1) (0.9 0.50) 0.10 0.45 0.55 55 perceent\nWhere did those percentages come from? They come from your having looked at\nyour indicator or indicator set over some past lookback period and written down\nevery gain and every loss and calculated the percentage of times you got each out-\ncome. You’ve read up on all the indicators and selected the ones you like and feel\nyou can handle. You have either eyeballed those indicators on a chart of your\nfavorite security or backtested them to verify the number of gains and the ratio of\ngains to losses.\nThe important point is that the expectancy is positive. It would be foolish to make\na trade that you expect would result in a loss.",

Say your trading, either real or hypothetical from the backtest,\ngenerates a win/loss ratio of 2:1, meaning a $2 gain for every $1 lost. This is\npretty good, right?\nYes, but it doesn’t go far enough. The win/loss ratio doesn’t link the gains and\nlosses to the amount of capital you put at risk and doesn’t help you figure out\nthe expectancy for the next trade. Maybe you made one trade in the year that\nnetted $200 on a capital stake of $10,000 and one that lost $100 in the same\nyear on the same $10,000. You still have a 2:1 win/loss ratio, but the rate of\nreturn on capital is tiny and the frequency of trading isn’t high enough to\ndeduce expectancy for the next trade.\n2.\nMeasure the expectancy.\nYou need to figure out whether you can have positive expectancy about the\nnext trade using your indicators.

That set of indicators isn’t good enough.\nHere’s the outcome from a different and better set of indicators, which I name\nIndicator Set 2. This new set of indicators generated 55 percent of winning\ntrades and 45 percent of losing trades, but the average winning trade gained\n$400 and the losing trades lost half that, or an average of $200 each.\nExpectancy on Indicator Set 2\n$400 55 percent $200 45 percent $220 $90 $130\nUsing this new Indicator Set 2, your expectancy for the next trade is a net $130,\nwhich is a whole lot better than $20, but $130 on how much capital and over\nhow many trades?\n98 PART 1 Getting Started with Technical Analysis",

You\nneed to add that in to the expectancy formula because the amount per trade affects\nthe outcomes over time. To get a handle on this idea, consider you have $10,000\nto put into securities trading, but you’re busy with a job and family, so you want\nto trade only four times a year, or once a quarter. Here’s the question: Given these\nconstraints, how much money can you expect to make by the end of the first year?\nIf you use the expectancy from the preceding Indicator Set 2 — that each trade has\na high probability of making $130 — and you’re trading only four times per year,\nyou have a high probability of making 4 × $130 = $520. Given a starting capital\nstake of $10,000, this plan doesn’t pass the so-what test. The so-what test asks\nhow much money you want to make as a multiple of starting capital. This outcome\nis a 5.2 percent gain, more than a bank savings account but not worth the time and\ntrouble of all that trading work.\nBack to the drawing board again, but you’ll keep Indicator Set 2. What you want to\nchange is the percentage gain on your $10,000 that makes the trading effort\nworthwhile. Say you want to double your stake to $20,000.",

You may think you can skip this step.\nTo calculate expectancy and apply it to find out your money gain and number of\ntrades needed is more about money or risk management than about technical\nanalysis itself. Note how many times in this book I say “No indicator works all the\ntime.” You should want to know how many times it fails and how much those\nfailures will cost you.

This chapter\ngives you the basics on how to read standard bars.\nThe standard bar I talk about in this chapter isn’t the only bar notation method\nout there. There are also the tick bar, momentum bar, point-and-figure bar, and\nmost importantly, candlestick bars. I describe each of these later in the book. The\ncandlestick bar (see Chapter 8), which came on the scene only 30 years ago, has\nzoomed to the top of the popularity rankings and is likely used by at least half of\nthe technical analysts working today. That’s because it’s visually compelling,\nwhereas the standard bar appears boring in contrast (until you tease out all its\nmeanings). A variation on candlestick bars is the heiken ashi bar, which rejiggers\nthe bar components.

After you have a grip\non the price bar, almost nothing in technical analysis can confuse you for long.\nHonest. Resist the temptation to skim over the bar material to get to more\nglamorous-sounding stuff.\nThe bar is the building block of most indicators, which are nothing more than an\narithmetic manipulation of the four price bar components of a series of bars over\nsome period of time. Get the classic bar concept down pat and you can make a\ngiant leap into technical analysis. For example, one of the most popular indicators\nis named the stochastic oscillator (see Chapter 13). It uses a formula that includes\nthe high, the low, and the close. You should have to a firm grip on the high, the\nlow, and close if you’re going to appreciate this indicator.\nIn addition to being able to grasp indicator construction, you want to figure out\nhow the bar works because every change in a trend begins with a bar or small\nseries of bars. Some traders never bother to move on to indicators at all and trade\nsolely on classic bars.

In fact, I made more profit in my own trading while I was\nwriting this chapter than at any other time in my trading life. I start off here with\na brief overview of the price bar and then detail each component in the sections\nthat follow.\nReality in a nutshell\nThe price bar describes and defines the trading action in a security for a given\nperiod, meaning actual deals done with cold, hard cash, not what somebody\nwished, imagined, or contemplated. For the sake of simplicity, this chapter refers\nto the daily price bar because that’s what you’ll be working with most of the time.\nA price bar can be in any increment — a minute, 10 minutes, 240 minutes, or a\nweek. It doesn’t matter; all price bars contain an open, high, low, and close. The\nprice dynamics I describe here are valid for all bars of any time frame.\nCheck out the standard price bar in Figure 6-1. Like all bars, it consists of four\ncomponents:\n» Open: The little horizontal line on the left is the opening price.\n» High: The top of the vertical line defines the high of the day.\n» Low: The bottom of the vertical line defines the low of the day.\n» Close: The little horizontal line on the right is the closing price.\n104 PART 2 Building Indicators from the Ground Up",

In trading par-\nlance, a tick represents a single trade at a single price, so the tick mark represent-\ning the open or the close refers literally to a single transaction or a batch of\ntransactions all at the same price and at the same time. The high and the low don’t\nneed a tick mark because the end of the bar conveys that information.\nThe daily price bar shows the effects of every price factor in the market for that\nday, including the overall environment, the fundamentals, and market sentiment.\nThe price bar tells you the outcome of the battle between the buyers (bulls) and\nthe sellers (bears). Every bar identifies the winning group and the losing group.\nIf the price opened at the low and closed at the high, the winners that day were the\nbuyers. If the price opened at the high and closed at the low, the winners that day\nwere the sellers. Each bar reflects a very real contest whose outcome is measured\nin dollars. If the bar is very tall, encompassing a $10 range when the normal bar\nfor this security is only $3, the trading was a Titanic battle. If the bar is very short,\nsay $1, it was a pillow fight. On every single trade, one party wins and the other\nparty loses. That is why trading — like war — is called a zero-sum game.\nThe relationship between price and volume is important in judging the bar. Every-\nthing that you infer from prices about the state of mind of the market needs to be\nconfirmed by volume. For example, if the price bar is three times the usual size,\nyou should verify from volume that a large number of traders were active that day.\nIt’s a mistake to see a battle if only one trade was done at the $10 high. That makes\nthe $10 price an anomaly.\nCHAPTER 6 Reading Basic Bars: How to Pounce on Opportunities 105",

But emotion may have nothing to do with it.\nTraders also make buy/sell decisions to manage risk.\nJust as some traders buy on the open as a standard practice, some traders sell\non the close, chiefly to eliminate the risk of loss if something happens overnight\nto push the price down. Institutions as well as individuals use this simple\nrisk-management tactic. Should you? Yes, if you fear the market could gap over\nyour stop.\nBecause so many people exit on the close, the close is seldom the high of the day.\nAnd when the close is at the exact high of the day, that’s useful information. It\nmeans people who do hold overnight positions are buying right up to the last\nminute, offsetting the usual end-of-day sales. This is a strongly bullish signal.\nGoing up: The high\nThe high of the price bar is literally the highest point of the bar. It’s the highest\nprice at which a buyer and seller made an exchange of cash for the security. The\nbuyer thinks the price will rise some more.

Fresh news that causes a new high or a new low is an event. The\nrisk that a new high or low will ensue from the news is an event risk. It may seem odd,\nbut most events aren’t surprises, but rather scheduled, such as\n• News or a rumor about the security, such as a company’s earnings announcement\n• Market-related events, such as options expiration dates or tax and calendar period\ndates\n• Scheduled releases, such as the Fed’s interest rate statement or any of a dozen\neconomic reports\nEvent risk also refers to unexpected developments:\n• Acts of terrorism and war.\n• Natural disasters.\n• Correlation of a stock to the performance of the major indices. Even if your stock is\ndoing well, for example, it can open down from the close the night before as a side\neffect of a drop in the index or sector to which it belongs.\n• Previous technical levels, such as a round number or a historic high or low (see\nChapter 4).\nTraders treat forecasts prepared by economists and analysts as though the event had\nalready happened precisely as predicted. In other words, they “build in” the forecast to\nthe price, creating the very high on the price bar that the news is supposed to produce.\nThis practice is named buy on the rumor, where “rumor” refers to the forecast.\nThe rest of the phrase is sell on the news.",

Some percentage of the\ntime, the evolution is visible in the form of a trend. In this section, I describe how\nto use combinations of bars to identify a trend.\nIdentifying an uptrend\nThe textbook-perfect uptrend is a series of up-day bars (close higher than the\nclose the day before) that have higher highs and higher lows in a majority of the\nbars. A series of higher highs implies the fourth factor: close above the open.\n» Higher high: When the high today is higher than the high yesterday or higher\nthan the high of the past few days, you have a higher high. Higher highs refers\nto visible peaks, not a higher high every single day. A series of higher highs\nsignals bullish sentiment.\n» Higher low: You qualify the higher high by the additional confirming condi-\ntion of higher lows.\nNow you have two pieces of evidence that bulls outnumber bears. A series of\nhigher highs together with higher lows hints that a trend is forming. After two\ndays, you aren’t yet sure what is happening, but you’re starting to get excited.\nAfter all, your goal in identifying a trend is to buy near the beginning of the trend.\nYour key assumption is that a trend, once formed, will continue.",

If you have two\nhigher highs with two higher lows, can you assume that Day 3 will also deliver a\nhigher high and a higher low?\nNot necessarily. Alas, prices don’t move in straight lines. You often see a series of\ntwo or three higher highs interrupted by one or two lower highs. This can happen\nfor several reasons:\n» Traders already in the security are taking an early profit.\n» The market is reconsidering whether the new high is really justified.\n» The higher highs were just a random accident.\nYou seldom see an unbroken series of higher highs on every single day. Go back to\nFigure 6-2. You see a series of days on which the close is higher than the close the\nday before. At the same time, the price is making a fresh high nearly every day, but\nnot every day without fail. See the bar marked Day 4. On that day, the close was\nhigher than the open and the low was higher than the day before, but the high of\nthe day wasn’t higher than the day before. Oh, oh. What does that mean?

It’s\nan uptrend, all right, and you know this because you have an unbroken series of\nhigher lows. Day 4 is a disappointment — it doesn’t deliver a higher high — but\nthe low is higher than all the previous lows. By considering the additional factor\nof higher lows, you confirm that the probability is pretty good at getting a higher\nhigh, if not also a higher close, on Day 5.\nPinpointing a downtrend\nA downtrend is a series of down-day bars (a close lower than the day before) char-\nacterized by lower lows and lower highs in a preponderance of the bars. Moreover,\nthe lower lows tend to lead to the close coming in below the open (although not in\nevery case). Look at the down-days in Figure 6-3. After the first day, each of these\nbars has a close lower than the close the day before. Day 3 has the same high as\nthe day before, but a lower low. On Day 3, you start to get the idea that this may\nbe the beginning of a downtrend.\nWhen identifying a downtrend, a series of lower highs is a good confirming indi-\ncator to the series of lower lows. The same psychology applies as when an uptrend\nstarts, only in reverse. Sellers see that new lows are occurring — somebody must\nknow something negative about the security.

In bar terms, a trend has two\nidentifiers — a series of higher highs (or lower lows) and a series of up-days (or\ndown-days). Technical analysis doesn’t offer a hard-and-fast rule on which\nidentifier is more important. Traditional technical analysis emphasizes that you\nneed higher lows to confirm the higher highs in an uptrend, but candlestick anal-\nysis, which I cover in Chapter 8, says that the position of the close trumps every\nother factor, including a new high or low.\nDifficult and confusing bar configurations arising from strange placement of\nhighs or lows is usually overcome by the candlestick notation method. The high\nand low appear on the bar, but only as a barely visible, skinny little line at the top\nor bottom of the main body of the bar, which features the open and close.

After all, a high or low may represent an extreme of sentiment or a ran-\ndom event. The midpoint of the bar is much closer to the concept of reversion to\nthe mean or central tendency in trending markets. See Chapter 8 for candlesticks\nand Chapter 18 for more about ichimoku.\nIf you usually prefer standard bars but find yourself confused by a particular set of\nbars, toggle your software to show the bars in candlestick format. You may get a\nflash of insight.\nPaying heed to bar series\nUsually a series of higher highs with higher lows or a series of lower lows with\nlower highs does mean that a trend is emerging, even if the close doesn’t yet con-\nfirm. Higher highs imply higher closes aren’t far behind as the logical outcome,\njust as lower closes are the eventual logical outcome of a series of lower lows.\nMarket players start wondering why other traders are taking the price to new\nhighs or lows. What do they know that you don’t? New highs and lows arouse\nemotions. A sufficiently large number of new highs triggers greed — better buy\nnow so you don’t miss out, even if you don’t know why the new high is occurring.\nAlternatively, new lows scare just enough traders that they sell their positions,\neven in the absence of any fresh news that would justify it.\nSometimes you get higher closes without getting a preponderance of higher highs.\nPay attention anyway because new highs may start to appear.

In practice, looking at data\nin different time frames is useful when you’re facing a trading decision. You can\nzoom out to a higher time frame (such as weekly) or zoom in to a shorter time\nframe (hourly).\nPrice bars are fractal, meaning you can’t tell by looking at a chart what time frame\nthe bars represent. If it’s not labeled, a chart of 15-minute price bars can’t be\ndistinguished from a chart showing daily bars. The bar components look the same,\nand traders attribute the same supply-demand assumptions to them.

It’s the base case.\n» Embracing daily price bars puts you on the same page with the majority of\npeople in the market.\n» Even people who use intraday data (such as hourly bars) also look at the daily\nprice bars.\nTechnical analysis writers are sensitive to the increased use of intraday data, and\ntoday usually speak of periods rather than days.

Mutual fund bars contain-\ning all the components are available only weekly. Quarterly and annual charts are\nseen less often. The universality of standard bar notation isn’t hard to\nunderstand — after all, a week has an opening price (the first trade on Monday\nmorning) and a closing price (the last trade on Friday afternoon), with a high and\na low somewhere in between.

Experts are\nreluctant to give advice on this point. In equities, many traders look only at the\nhourly chart.

If an\nhourly charts looks noisy to you, go up a notch to 2 hours. Selecting the interval to\nuse in displaying bars is subjective. Remember, bar reading is a visual art. Other\ntimes you may prefer to look at what everyone else is looking at, on the principle\nthat following the crowd is usually the right way to forecast.\nYou want an interval that accurately represents activity in the security and suits\nyour needs at the same time.

Liquidity refers to existing and potential volume — not only the players on the\nfield but also the bench players waiting around for their chance at bat, meaning a\nprice that pleases them and triggers a trade, with an opposing bench of sellers\nwilling to throw balls until somebody takes a swing. A liquid security has lots of\nbuyers and sellers, with some of them active at all times, including market-makers\nwho are required to post a bid-offer at all times.

Techniques include fancy processes like finding\nhow far the close varies above (or below) the standard deviation of the past x\nnumber of bars.\nThe simplest bar-scoring exercise takes four bar types and checks how these bars\nwould have worked to generate a profit on the next day. Fitschen examined the\nbars against 3,372 stocks from 2000 to June 2011 that qualified by having liquidity\nof at least $20 million per day. He also ran the bar-type test against 56 futures\ncontracts going back to 1980 and ending in June 2011. In total, he had 3.5 million\nequity bars that qualified and 363,000 futures bars. Here’s what they look like and\nhow the bars shake out.\n» Bar-type 1: Close over the open and the close in the top half of the range.\n» Bar-type 2: Close over the open but the close in the lower half of the range.\n» Bar-type 3: Close under or near the open and the close in the upper half of\nthe range.\n» Bar-type 4: Close under or near the open but the close in the lower half of the\nrange.\nNow add the close from the preceding day’s bar so the current close is higher or\nlower. This multiplies the four types of bars to eight. Quick, which bar-type is the\nwinner? See Figure 6-5.\n118 PART 2 Building Indicators from the Ground Up",

But\nfor both equities and futures, Bar 1 isn’t the winner. And to complicate matters,\nequities have a different winner than futures.\nIn equities, the winner is bar-type 4, which returned 0.1045 percent or roughly\n$5.00 on a starting stake of $5,000, by the close the next day. It has a higher high\nand higher close, but the close is in the lower half of the bar and below the open.\nIn futures, the winner is bar-type 7, returning $18.63 from tomorrow’s open to\ntomorrow’s close. The dollar gain is higher than in equities because contract sizes\nare bigger than the $5,000 assumed for equities. If you assume an average contract\nsize of $20,000, the return is 0.09 percent, roughly comparable to the return on\nequities. Fitschen notes that in futures, bar-types 5 through 8 are all profitable\neven though the close is below the close the day before, implying that futures\ncloses are counter-trend, because a lot of futures traders prefer not to hold\npositions overnight and they tend to exit near the close. He also says three of the\nfour bar types that close up on the day go down the next day, which means bar\nreading in futures is trickier than in equities.\nFitschen’s bar-scoring demonstrates that you don’t need all four bar criteria lined\nup simultaneously to make profitable trades on bar-reading.\nCHAPTER 6 Reading Basic Bars: How to Pounce on Opportunities 119",

Bar configura-\ntions come in endless combinations and permutations, and you can’t pos-\nsibly memorize them all. But knowing about the special bars is useful\nbecause they can be powerful predictors — and everyone knows it.\nSpecial bars are a small series of two to five bars — called combinations or\nconfigurations — that stand out on a chart. You can see them immediately, and\nso can everyone else. Most special bars and configurations are either trend-\nconfirmation or trend-reversal patterns, but even when they’re ambiguous, you\nneed to sit up and take notice. This chapter takes a closer look at these special bars\nand explains what you need to know.\nFinding Clues to Trader Sentiment\nYou use price bar combinations to determine whether your security is starting a\ntrend, staying on a trend, or losing its grip on the trend. The start of a new trend\nis sometimes the end of an old one, called a reversal. Keep reading for more about\nthe clues you may find.\nCHAPTER 7 Special Bars — An Early Warning System 121",

It takes almost no practice\nat all to differentiate ordinary out-of-line bars from special configurations that\ntraders consider to be associated with specific interpretations.\nIn a series of three bars, each having four components, you can get any one of\n2,463 permutations of configuration. When you specify joint conditions, such as\nhigher high together with higher low, the number of combinations reaches into\nthe millions — and that’s just with three bars! So, when you see the special cases,\nyou know that you’ve got a valuable clue to upcoming price behavior.\nEven so, the interpretation guidelines aren’t right all the time. In fact, nobody can\ntell you even roughly what percentage of the time the standard interpretation is\ncorrect because it may be correct all the time in one security but only 30 percent\nof the time in another or correct 75 percent of the time in one year but only\n50 percent in another in the same security. This inconsistency is probably why\nsome technical analysts get very fussy about defining special bar configurations.\nThey’ll argue passionately that their definition of a key reversal bar is the only\nright one, or their idea about gaps is the only way to look at gaps.

After discounting noise, remember that each security has bar config-\nuration habits that reflect the trading habits of the crowd that trades it.

Refer to the following section\n“Identifying Common Special Bars” for definitions of these special bars.\nTrading range\nIn every instance of special bars in this chapter, the size of the daily high-low\nrange is a key factor.

A series of closes at\nthe high — and its downtrending counterpart, closes at the low — indicate that the\nexisting trend is likely to continue. In Figure 7-1, Configuration A illustrates\ncloses at the high for three days running, and the third bar is much longer than\nthe others, which means the high-low range is wider than the previous two days.\nSo, what’s up?\nThe first two bars show the close at the high at about the same level. On the sec-\nond bar, the low of the day was lower than the low the day before, meaning that\nsellers came out of the woodwork. But the bulls fought back, buying more and\nmore, so that the close was still at the high, trumping the lower low. Day three\ndelivers a whopping gain — and a third close at the high.

Three days isn’t enough to call this configuration a\ntrend, so traders call it a move. It doesn’t matter whether the closes-at-high occur\nat the start of a trend or while the trend is in progress — a fat gain always\ninspires some traders to take profit. Profit-taking doesn’t change a trend, but it\ncan dent performance the next day. You can use your imagination (or turn the\nbook upside down) to envision the parallel configuration on Configuration A of\nFigure 7-1 — closes at the low. As you may expect, a series of closes at the low\nimply that a downtrend is forming or worsening.\nSpending the day inside\nConfiguration B in Figure 7-1 shows the inside day. An inside day refers to a price\nbar in which the high is lower than the previous day’s high and the low is higher\nthan the previous day’s low. In other words, today’s high-low range is inside the\nprevious day’s high-low range. It reflects indecision. Buyers didn’t feel strongly\nenough about this security to buy more. Sellers weren’t particularly inspired to\nsell, either. The inside day doesn’t suggest what’s going to happen the following\nday, but does warn that the market is starting to reconsider what it feels about\nthis security.\nSome commentators opine that an inside day is always a continuation bar.

If the price series is untrended, the outside\nday alerts you to a possible trend beginning. If a trend is in place, the placement\nof the close relative to the open may be a hint of an upmove or downmove — but\nnot always.\nFinding the close at the open\nConfiguration D in Figure 7-1 shows a series of bars where the close is at or near the\nopen. As you can guess, a close at or near the open reflects indecision among market\nparticipants. Trader opinion is divided as to whether this bar generally signifies a\ncontinuation or reversal pattern. Consider it a clue to look at what else is going on,\nsuch as trading volume. In candlestick charting, the open at or near the close is\nnamed a doji, a term I promise you’ll come to use with ease (see Chapter 8).\nDecoding Spikes\nWhile the inside day and the outside day in Figure 7-1 have high-low ranges\nnoticeably different from the preceding bars, they don’t make your hair stand on\nend.

Do spikes matter? Yes, a spike is often the harbinger\nof an important price reversal and that’s why traders keep an eye peeled for\nspikes.\nBut sometimes a spike is just randomly generated by rumors and market silliness.\nThe spike turns out to be an anomaly. The top example in Figure 7-2 shows such\na case. The spike low suggests that some people panicked and were selling so\nmuch and at such a frantic pace that buyers got a bargain at abnormally low prices.\nBut panic was misplaced. The next day, the price resumed its uptrend and its same\n“normal” high-low range. The spike was just noise. Maybe the panicked sellers\nbelieved a rumor that the buyers didn’t hear or knew was false. Or perhaps the\nsellers were deliberately trying to break a support line, as I describe in Chapter 10.\nJack Schwager in his book Technical Analysis (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.) writes that\nthe return of prices to a previous spike extreme means a failed signal.\nThe bottom spike example in Figure 7-2 is, in contrast, an important bar named a\nkey reversal because over the next few days, the price proceeds to make lower highs\nand lower lows, signaling a trend reversal.

In practice, you don’t need a new higher high; you just need the\nseries of lower highs and lower lows. And it can take more than one bar after the\nspike low to confirm the reversal because the confirmation point is the close sur-\npassing the spike low. In fact, a key reversal bar can be an ordinary bar and isn’t\nalways a spike, but when you see a spike, always ask yourself whether it might be\na setup for a pending reversal.\nAs the spike is occurring, you don’t know where the low is going to come until\nafter the bar is completed, and obviously you can’t exit the trade until then (in\nother words, in the next trading session). You still don’t know what bars will\nensue, but you can make note of the spike low after it forms and keep it in mind\nas a benchmark for a stop, even if the bars that follow the spike retrace some of\nthe downmove, as they do in Figure 7-2.

As a general rule, you’re safe assuming that the close is\nthe most important part of the bar because it sums up the sentiment for\nthe day. To see the usefulness of the close, take a look at the two examples\nin Figure 7-2:\n• Continuation spike: In the top chart showing a spike low, the close is near\nthe high. The wider high-low range and the lower low are a worry, to be\nsure, but the position of the close near the high trumps those worries.\n• Key reversal day: The bottom chart in Figure 7-2 shows three compo-\nnents to worry about — not only the wide high-low range but also the\nlower low and close near the low.\nA conservative trading tactic is to order your broker to sell the security if the price\nfalls below the low of the spike day over the next two or three days. This method\nis plain old crowd-following. Everybody can see the same spike low and many will\nhave sell orders at that level, and you should, too. The bar following a spike is\noften an inside day. Other times the following bar has a new higher high only\na few pennies above the spike high and a close lower than the spike bar close.\nNeither bar is helpful.

The same thing happens when a security gaps\nduring the day on an hourly chart — the daily bar doesn’t show it.\nFIGURE 7-3:\nPrice gap.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nGaps are usually triggered by news, like earnings or some other event, whether\ntrue or invented. That’s why gaps are such a valuable pattern — you know\ninstantly how the market is interpreting the news.\nThe reason to read bars is to get an accurate assessment of whether news is big or\nmerely ordinary — noise. Some news is easy to interpret. News will start a new\nuptrend if it’s wildly favorable or halt an uptrend dead in its tracks if it’s wildly\nunfavorable. But much of the time, you don’t know how to interpret news — and\neveryone is overloaded with too much news! — until you see how the market\ntreats it in the form of the bar on the chart. Traders often get the bit between their\nteeth on news and this is especially clear with gaps.\nConsider how a gap develops. Say that Blue Widget stock closes on Monday at\n$15 per share. After the closing bell, it announces bad news — the bookkeeper\nembezzled $20 million and ran off to Rio. The market is unforgiving and the next\nday, Blue Widget opens gap down at $10. Most people deduce that the opening gap\ndown implies further price drops, and they proceed to sell — in droves.\nThe total gap for the day may not be $5, though. During the course of the day, Blue\nWidget may trade as high as $12, making the net gap a $3 gap. If the price of Blue\nWidget normally trades in a $2 high-low range, $3 is still a significant number —\n50 percent higher than normal. Gaps are significant when they’re proportionally\nlarge compared to the trading range (see the “Kicking things off: Breakaway\ngaps” section in this chapter).\n128 PART 2 Building Indicators from the Ground Up",

If Blue Widget announces a fabulous new discov-\nery, the opening price on the following day may be a gap up, like the one in\nFigure 7-3. You may deduce from this gap that some traders (including well-paid\nprofessional analysts) had a whole night to evaluate the news, and they bought the\nstock at the open, so you should buy it, too. The gap implies buyers anticipate the\nstock rising throughout the day from the opening price, and you want to jump (if\nnot leap) on this bandwagon. In equities, you can pretty much count on an open-\ning gap on the day after an initial public offering.\nUsing gaps to your advantage\nGaps are, indeed, a wonderful trading opportunity if you can differentiate between\na common gap and uncommon gaps. In the following sections, I describe the main\ntypes of gaps and how to use them.\nLacking opportunity: Common gaps\nA common gap is one that appears out of nowhere for no particular reason and\nshould be considered noise. Common gaps can occur in trending and nontrending\nprices. If the price is trending, it fails to change the trend. If the price isn’t trend-\ning, it fails to initiate a trend. Common gaps are generally insignificant.\nWhat causes a common gap? Usually it’s a simple error.

A trader heard or thought\nhe heard a market-moving bit of news and made an offer above (or below) the\nmarket. Or the trader was trying to break a trendline or had some other hidden\nagenda.\nCommon gaps often occur when liquidity is low, meaning only a few players are\nin the market. A security that normally has low volume tends to have more gaps\nthan heavily traded securities. A low-volume security is described as thinly traded,\nmeaning few market participants. Don’t try to interpret gaps in thinly traded\nsecurities. These gaps are usually just common gaps and mean nothing at all. At\nthe same time, a heavily traded security can also have gaps as traders flail around\ntrying to validate the new gap direction because it favors their existing position or\nfight against the new gap direction because if the price keeps going, their existing\nposition will suffer a loss. Another cause of gaps in heavily traded securities is the\nfist-fight between bulls and bears changing their interpretation of a new event.\nThis is fairly common in the foreign exchange and commodity markets.\nTo judge an opening gap, consult volume. If volume is low or normal, traders\naren’t jumping on the bandwagon, and it’s probably a common gap. If volume is\nabnormally high, traders are jumping on the bandwagon, and the gap will prob-\nably lead to a big rise or fall in the coming days.\nCHAPTER 7 Special Bars — An Early Warning System 129",

Not only do you get the gap and a new\ntrend, but you also get a major change in the appearance of the chart, such as a\nwidening of the normal high-low daily trading range, an increase in day-to-day\nvolatility, and much higher volume. A breakaway gap is often confirmed as\nsignificant when the price breaks support or resistance, or a channel or band. All\nthese changes occur because the breakaway gaps draw in new traders.

New buyers want to\nown the security and are willing to pay ever-higher prices to get it. Volume is\nnoticeably higher than usual.\n» Downside breakaway gap: Traders can’t wait to get rid of their holdings and\naccept ever-lower prices to achieve that goal. Volume is usually (but not\nalways) abnormally high.\nContinuing the push: Runaway gaps\nA runaway gap occurs after a security is already moving in a trended way and fresh\nnews comes out that promotes the existing trend. See the second gap in Figure 7-4.\nWhat’s the difference between a breakaway gap and a runaway gap? A breakaway\ngap starts a trend. A runaway gap continues a trend. In both cases, buyers become\nexuberant and offer higher and higher prices. Sometimes fresh good news bursts\nforth, sometimes traders make up fresh good news, and sometimes the buying\nfrenzy is just feeding on itself in the absence of any news at all.\nNotice in Figure 7-4 that after making new highs following the runaway gap, the\nprice fell a little. A falling price after a dramatic move up is called a pullback. The\nsecurity stops making new higher highs and may make some lower lows, but it\ndoesn’t go as far as the low on the breakaway day.

In\nfact, professionals count on the pullback to “buy on the dip.” If they get really\nenthusiastic, reentering professional traders often supply the energy for a runa-\nway gap that follows a breakaway gap.\nCalling it quits: Exhaustion gaps\nExhaustion gaps occur at the end of a trend, signaling that the party’s over. Volume\nis usually low. What’s exhausted is the news that propelled the security up in the\nfirst place and the energy of the early buyers. An exhaustion gap is usually fol-\nlowed by a reversal.\nHere’s how it works. This example is an exhaustion gap at the end of an uptrend,\nbut the mechanics are similar for a downtrend exhaustion gap as well. When you\nsee a gap up in an existing uptrend and volume is low on that day, you have to\nwonder why the gap appeared. Volume tells you that buyers aren’t pounding on\nthe sellers’ doors to get the security.\nPresumably some greedy seller is out there, along with one last fool who’s willing\nto pay a gap-worth more than the last trade.

When he turns around and tries to unload his recent purchase, he finds\nno buyers, at least no buyers at a profit to him, and has to dump the security\nat a loss.\nYou can distinguish an exhaustion gap from a runaway gap by looking at volume,\nwhich is usually low at an exhaustion gap. Anytime you see wild new highs (or\nlows) that aren’t accompanied by wild new high volume, be suspicious of the\nstaying power of the move. You can exit altogether or move up your stop-loss\norder.\nScoring big: Island reversals\nSometimes an exhaustion gap is followed immediately by a breakaway gap going\nin the other direction (see previous sections for details on exhaustion and break-\naway gaps). This occurrence is how an island reversal forms. An island reversal is a\nsingle, isolated price bar with a gap up on one side and a gap down on the other.\nIt looks like an island in a sea of price bars and is almost always an unusually long\nbar — a wide high-low range.\nTake a look at Figure 7-5. You see a series of higher highs, including a minor gap\nup, but then the last buyers realize that they’re all alone on top of the mountain.\nThey start to sell in a panic and are willing to accept a much lower price. Now the\nprice takes off in the opposite direction on a breakaway gap. Remember, a break-\naway gap tends to have high volume.\nFIGURE 7-5:\nIsland reversal.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n132 PART 2 Building Indicators from the Ground Up",

As in the\ncase of the key reversal bar, some analysts insist an island reversal is a single bar,\nwhereas others insist it can be or should be a set of bars. The important point is\ntwo gaps, not how many bars form the island. What is being defined is a change\nin sentiment so powerful that it signals a reversal.\nWatching volume can get a little tricky. The island reversal bar has a higher high\nbut is accompanied by low volume. This combination is the warning. The next day,\nas the breakaway gap develops, it has unusually high volume. High volume in\ncombination with the downward gap is an indication that early selling is strong;\nlater prices aren’t going to go back and fill that gap.\nNow consider this case in reverse order. Everyone and his brother has been dump-\ning the security, and it’s been gapping downward as it trends downward. This\ntime the frenzy is a selling frenzy. At some point, traders realize that the selling\nhas gone on long enough and maybe the price is now too low — a bargain.

This emphasis on filling the gap is usually\nnonsense uttered by people who are trying to sound worldly and wise, but really\ndon’t know what type of gap they’re dealing with. Filling the gap (see Figure 7-6)\nmeans that prices return to the level they occupied before the gap.\nFIGURE 7-6:\nFilling a gap.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nIf a security takes off on a breakaway gap, sometimes the price doesn’t return to\nfill the gap for many months or even years — if ever. Stop and think about it:\nWhen the fundamentals of a security change dramatically, why would market\nparticipants sell it back down to the level it was before the big event? Conditions\nhave changed permanently and so has the price of the security. If a company has\ninvented some new must-have product, the new higher stock prices may not be\nthe right price, but the old prices based on the old conditions aren’t right either.\nA runaway gap or common gap is another matter. Demand for the security is\nnormal and not under the influence of news or changing conditions, so the gap\nmay be filled by bargain hunters. Sometimes a gap gets filled because the chatter\nabout filling the gap makes it a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n134 PART 2 Building Indicators from the Ground Up",

You need to look at other indicators (such as\nmomentum in Chapter 13) to confirm whether a price move is at risk of going back\nto fill a gap.\nUsing the Trading Range as a Tool\nThe length of the price bar, the trading range, plays a role in the special bar con-\nfigurations such as spikes. But the trading range also has meaning in its own\nright. As I define in the “Trading range” section earlier in this chapter, the trading\nrange is the difference between the high and the low. If you see a security that has\nbeen averaging a $3 high-low range and suddenly it starts trading consistently in\na $5 range, something happened — no matter where the opens and closes are. The\nfollowing sections discuss how you can utilize the trading range.\nPaying attention to a changing range\nWhen market conditions change, the average trading range is sometimes the first\naspect of price behavior to change.\nA change in the high-low range, which you can see in Figure 7-7, usually precedes\nor accompanies a change in the direction or slope of a trend. Take note — it’s\noften a leading indicator.\nFIGURE 7-7:\nRange expansion\nand contraction.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n» Range expansion is a lengthening of the price bars over time — the high-low\nrange is getting wider (visible in Chart A of Figure 7-7) — and usually suggests\na continuation pattern.\nCHAPTER 7 Special Bars — An Early Warning System 135",

This rising volume usually accompanies range\nexpansion and is an excellent indication of an accelerating trend. The\nacceleration can be in either direction, up or down. If you see an expansion\nof the range and it fails to have an accompanying rise in volume, you have\na mystery and need to look at some other indicators, like momentum (see\nChapter 13).\n• Shrinking volume: Fewer people are in the market for this security, or\nexisting traders are reducing their allocations to this security.",

Range contraction usually means that activity is\ndrying up and volume is low — so if you see high volume and a lower close\nin a contracting range, you probably want to get out of Dodge.\nLooking at the average trading range\nThe trading range is a valuable analytical tool. But you want to capture a change\nin the range in some more-efficient way than eyeballing a bunch of bars and try-\ning to figure out whether they’re getting bigger or smaller. What you want is an\naverage.\nYou know what an average is — you measure ten of something, add up the mea-\nsurements, and divide by ten. If you have ten days’ worth of high-low ranges that\nadd up to $32, you know that the average daily trading range for the ten-day\nperiod was $3.20.\nThe average trading range is one of the best tools around for keeping your sanity\nand perspective. If you know that the average daily trading range is $3.20, the\nmost you can expect to make on this security in a single day is $3.20, and that’s\nassuming that you could buy at the exact low and sell at the exact high — and\nassuming that it’s an average day.\nWhen your broker, your brother-in-law, or an email solicitation says you can\nmake $500 in the next month in a specific security, you can use the average range\nto judge whether it’s even remotely possible.",

If the security moves up by its full\naverage $3.20 range every day with no pullbacks for the entire 22 days in a trading\nmonth, your gain would be $70.40. Unless your informant has certain knowledge\nof some news or event that is going to change things, his forecast is silly.

Say that\nyou’re merrily averaging your daily high-low ranges and suddenly you have a gap.\nYou need to account for that gap or you will be literally missing something.\nFigure 7-8 displays the problem. On Day 1, the high-low range is $2. The next day,\nthe price opens gap up, but the daily range is the same $2. Therefore, the average\nrange for the two days is also $2. Looking at the average range alone, without\ninspecting the chart itself, you wouldn’t know that the gap occurred. Well, so\nwhat? Maybe the gap is just a common old gap that doesn’t mean anything. If it’s\nan important gap, like a breakaway gap, the range would automatically expand.\nCHAPTER 7 Special Bars — An Early Warning System 137",

The reason you need to account for the gap is that it often\nprecedes a longer-term change in the range, which is what you’re looking for. If\nyou measure each day separately and average those numbers, the range looks the\nsame from day to day. For the first two days in Figure 7-8, though, the range is\nactually from the low on Day 1 at $1 to the high on Day 2 at $7 — or a $6 range. In\nshort, the range doubled but the averaging process doesn’t capture this change. In\nfact, if the range on Day 2 had been smaller, say $1.50, the average would be less\nthan $2. Just looking at the average range on a numerical basis, you would think\nthat the range had contracted — exactly the opposite of what really happened.\nDiscovering the average true range\nIf you want to make a trading decision based on a change in the average trading\nrange, you need to adjust the averaging process to account for possible gaps. You\ndo this by starting at the most important component of the price bar: the close. As\na rule, to calculate the true range today after a gap, you start from the close on the\nday before and end at today’s high. You’re substituting the first day’s close for the\nsecond day’s open in order to incorporate the gap.\nIn Figure 7-8, Day 1’s range was ordinary. The gap happened afterward. Why not\nuse Day 1’s high rather than the close? Aren’t you double-counting by including\nthe space between the high and the close from Day 1? No, because in range work\nyou don’t really care about the gap itself — you care about the total range of prices\ntoday. The close was the end of trading yesterday, and you’re now considering it\nthe start of trading today. Because the close is the most important part of the bar,\ntraders are hypersensitive to an opening gap away from yesterday’s close.\n138 PART 2 Building Indicators from the Ground Up",

Pretend that the close on Day 1 was $3,\nor $2 over the open at $1. Subtracting that close from the high on Day 2 at $7, you\nget a true range of $4. Averaging that with the original Day 1 range of $2, you get\n$3, the average true range. If Day 2’s price bar gaps downward, you incorporate\nthe gap by measuring from the close on Day 1 to the low on Day 2.\nFIGURE 7-9:\nThe average\ntrue range.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nWhy the word true? Because the inventor of the idea, J. Welles Wilder, Jr., selected\nthis word. The average true range is sometimes called Wilder’s average true range,\nor simply ATR. ATR is generally shown as a 14-day moving average, although\nyou’re welcome to fiddle with the number of periods.\nThe bigger the shift in the size of the range, the bigger the trading opportunity (or\nwarning to exit). You judge a shift in average true range the same way as in a\nregular high-low range but with greater confidence that you’re measuring and\nnot just eyeballing. If your security normally trades in a daily range of $10 and\nthen it starts trading at $6, $4, and $2, something is happening. Go find out\nwhat — or get out.\nIn Figure 7-10, for example, you see a price in the bottom window on an uptrend,\nbut the average true range in the top window is falling.

Candlestick patterns became instantly popular because they\nembody the principle of imputing trader sentiment to the bars, as in “shaven\ntop,” where the close is at the high. As I say in Chapter 6, the close at the high\nmeans strong bullish sentiment. Today every software program offers to display\nbars in the conventional way or in candlestick format. Trading guides abound on\nhow to use candlesticks. Steve Bigalow has several books on candlestick trading\n(and software add-ons), including Profitable Candlestick Trading and High Profit\nCandlestick Patterns (both published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).\nIn this chapter, I break down the components of a candlestick and explain why\ncandlesticks are so useful. Note that in some instances, a stand-alone candlestick\nis a pattern in its own right, and such candlesticks always have a name. (For more\non patterns, check out Chapter 9.)

The names help you remember what the pattern\nmeans. Among the colorful names are “abandoned baby,” “dark cloud cover,”\nand “spinning top.”\n» Candlestick bar patterns and their interpretation are widely known so you can\nexpect other participants in the market to respond in a specific way to specific\npatterns.\n» You can use candlesticks on any chart, with any other indicators, just like\nstandard bars.\n» Candlestick shapes can be dramatic, so they can often bring your attention to\na trend change earlier than standard bars do.

The color of\nthe real body tells you how the daily struggle between the bulls and the bears\nplayed out. Note that in candlesticks, the real body emphasizes the open-close\nrange, whereas in traditional bar charting, you look at the high-low range, as\ndiscussed in Chapter 7.\nThe colors mean the following:\n» White real body: The close is higher than the open. A real body is bullish, and\nthe longer the body, the more bullish it is. A long candlestick indicates that the\nclose was far above the open, implying aggressive buying. In the daily battle of\nbulls and bears, the bulls won.\n» Black real body: The close is lower than the open. A black real body is\nbearish, and the longer the body, the more bearish it is. A long black candle-\nstick indicates a preponderance of sellers throughout the session. In the daily\nbattle of bulls and bears, the bears won.\nThe two candlestick bars in Figure 8-1 show the identical open and close, but col-\noring one of them black creates the optical illusion that it’s bigger. That black bar\ndemands your attention, which is one reason candlestick charting is appealing\nand effective. (For more appealing aspects, see the section “Appreciating the\nCandlestick Advantage” earlier in this chapter.)\nCHAPTER 8 Redrawing the Price Bar: Japanese Candlesticks 143",

Although you may sometimes use a\nsingle candlestick bar as an indicator in its own right, most of the time you use it\nin relation to the bars that precede it. One small white-body bar in a sea of black\nbars, for example, may mean the bulls won that day, but it was a minor event.\nThe one white bar may signal that the bears are losing power, but you wouldn’t\nuse it all by itself to call the end of a black-bar downtrend.\nDoing without a real body: The doji\nA candlestick that has no real body or only a very small one is named a doji.\nIn a doji, the open and the close are at the same or nearly the same level. See\nFigure 8-2 for three types of dojis. On its own, a doji doesn’t tell you much about\nmarket sentiment except that traders are indecisive and sentiment is in a transi-\ntional phase. It’s a neutral bar, neither bullish nor bearish, that gains meaning\nfrom its placement compared to the preceding bars.\nFIGURE 8-2:\nDoji candlestick\npatterns.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nWhen you see a doji after a prolonged uptrend, the doji may mean that the buyers\nare coming to the end of their bullish enthusiasm. A doji immediately after a very\nlong white bar in an uptrend shows that the market is tired. This particular doji is\nnamed a bearish doji star. A bullish doji star is a mirror image — it comes after a\nbig black bar in a downtrend. In most cases, it signals an impending reversal.\nThe doji form contains important information, regardless of the shadows,\nalthough shadows have their own additional meaning and are covered in a later\nsection. Always take notice of a doji or series of dojis after a trend has been in\nplace for a while. It’s a transitional bar, and you should always be on the lookout\nfor any transition that can affect your trade.\n144 PART 2 Building Indicators from the Ground Up",

Although the shadow is secondary to\nthe real body in importance, shadows contribute useful information about market\npsychology, too, and modify your interpretation of the body. Shadows offer special\ninterpretive clues in three instances:\n» The real body is a doji.\n» The shadow is missing.\n» The shadow is extremely long.\nShadows in the doji bar\nIn many instances, the doji is just a plain one with ordinary, same-size shadows,\nas shown in Figure 8-2. However, the two most useful types of doji bars, also\nshown in Figure 8-2, are the following:\n» Dragonfly doji: Look for the long lower shadow that means the open, high,\nand close were the same or nearly the same. Sellers were trying to push the\nprice down and succeeded in making a low — but they didn’t succeed in\ngetting it to close there. Because the close was back up at or near the open,\nbuyers must have emerged before the end of trading and bought enough to\nmove the close to or near the high.\nHow you interpret the dragonfly depends on what bar patterns precede it.\nYour options include the following:\n• If the price move is a downtrend, the dragonfly may mean that buyers are\nemerging and the downtrend may be ending.\n• If the dragonfly appears after a series of uptrending bars, buyers failed to\npush the price over the open to a new high while sellers succeeded in\ngetting a low, so the uptrend may be in trouble.\n» Gravestone doji: Take a look at that long upper shadow in Figure 8-2.\nThis bar, the exact opposite of the dragonfly, is formed when the open,\nlow, and close are the same or nearly the same, but a high creates a long\nupper shadow. Although buyers succeeded in pushing the price to a high\nover the open, by the end of the day the bears were fighting back and\npushed the price back to close near the open and the low.

Sellers dominated and the uptrend is at\nrisk of ending.\n• If the price move is a downtrend, the gravestone doji may mean that\nbuyers are emerging and the downtrend may be ending.\nMissing shadows\nThe absence of a shadow at one end is called a shaven top or a shaven bottom. To get\na shaven top or bottom, the open or close must be exactly at the high or the low, as\nyou can see in Figure 8-3. These candlestick bar notations are called marubozu\ncandles, and you can classify the types of candles by using the following\ndescriptions:\n» Shaven top: No upper shadow exists when the open or close is at the high.\nA shaven top can be black or white, and come about in two ways:\n• If the open is at the high, the day’s trading was all downhill. Not only is\nit a black candlestick, bearish to begin with, but it’s also doubly bearish\nthat no net new buying occurred after the open.\n• If the close is at the high, the net of the day’s trading was at higher\nprices, which is bullish. The candlestick is also (by definition) white —\na bullish sign.\n» Shaven bottom: No lower shadow exists when the open or the close is at the\nlow of the day. A shaven bottom can come in two ways:\n• If the open is at the low, bulls dominated all the day’s trading.\n• If the close is at the low, all the day’s trading points to bearish sentiment.\nFIGURE 8-3:\nMissing shadows.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n146 PART 2 Building Indicators from the Ground Up",

They may or may not follow through the next\nday by pushing the close to the high or low breaking point, though. Evaluating a\nlong shadow is therefore tricky.\nFIGURE 8-4:\nVery long\nshadows.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nAs a general rule, judge a long shadow by its placement on the chart (relative to\npreceding bars), such as the following:\n» Long upper shadow: The high of the day came well above both the open and\nthe close, whether the real body is black or white. Here’s how you can\ninterpret a really long upper shadow:\n• If the price series is in an uptrend, the long upper shadow is a failure\nto close near the high. If the uptrend is nearing a resistance level (see\nChapter 10 for a discussion of resistance), the long upper shadow may\nsignal a weakening of the uptrend. If a long upper shadow follows a doji\nbar indicating indecisiveness, you should worry that the uptrend may\nbe over.\n• If the price series is on a downtrend, the long upper shadow suggests that\nsome market participants are buying at higher levels. Especially if a long\nupper shadow follows a doji bar, you should wonder if the downtrend\nmight be ending.\n» Long lower shadow: A long lower shadow means that the low of the day\ncame well under both the open and the close, whether the real body is black\nor white. Here’s what that probably means:\n• If the price series is trending down, the long lower shadow is a failure\nto close near the low. If the downtrend is nearing a support level (see\nChapter 10), the long lower shadow may signal a weakening or an end\nof the downtrend.\nCHAPTER 8 Redrawing the Price Bar: Japanese Candlesticks 147",

They were exiting under the high, and therefore think that new highs\naren’t warranted. This signal can be a warning sign of the trend decelerat-\ning or ending.\nSizing Up Emotions\nIdentifying when traders are reaching the end of their emotional tether is one of\nthe primary goals of candlestick charting. And a change in the size of the bar is\none of the best indicators of this. The candlestick technique sensitizes you to spot\nextremes of emotion, which is why it’s a valuable tool for marking possible sup-\nport and resistance at overbought or oversold levels (which I discuss in Chapter 2).\nYou can also easily spot range expansion or contraction (see Chapter 7).\nFor example, at the beginning of the “Dissecting the Anatomy of a Candlestick”\nsection, I discuss the idea that the longer the bar, the more bullish or bearish it is.\nIf you’re looking at a series of medium-sized bars and suddenly see one relatively\nlong bar (as you can see in Figure 8-5), it may be telling you that support or resis-\ntance has been reached. Support marks an extreme level where buyers perceive\nthat the price is relatively cheap, and resistance marks an extreme level where\nsellers perceive that the price is relatively high, inspiring profit-taking or least an\nend to accumulation.

If you look at this chart in standard bar notation, as shown in the bottom\nillustration of Figure 8-5, you might say to yourself, “Higher high, higher lows,\nhigher closes, trend okay.” But the unusually tall bar stands out more promi-\nnently in candlestick mode — especially following the transitional doji — and\nalerts you to the possibility that all the buyers who were going to buy have just\ndone so in one last burst, and the price may have formed a resistance level at the\ntop of the bar (the close, in this case).\nIf the long bar were a black bar, denoting that the close was lower than the open,\nyou would find it easy to deduce that the upmove might be ending. A long black bar\nimplies panic selling. But to interpret the white bar as an ending burst in an uptrend\nis more subtle. In fact, an expert in reading standard bars would see the same\nthing. Candlesticks just make it easier, especially for traders just starting out.\nIdentifying Special Emotional Extreme\nCandlestick Patterns\nDozens of possible bar placement combinations and permutations are possible.

In\nthis section, I cover several of the most popular patterns and how you can tell the\ndifference between them. These special emotional extreme candlestick patterns\nare unique to candlestick analysis and don’t appear in the standard pattern analy-\nsis I discuss in Chapter 9.\nInterpreting candlestick patterns\nTwo similar candlesticks or candlestick patterns often have the exact opposite\ninterpretation, depending on where they fall in a series. You have to memorize the\nexact patterns to avoid getting confused. I select just two of the many candlestick\npatterns to illustrate how tricky some candlestick interpretation can get.\nHammer and hanging man\nBoth of these candlestick types have a small real body and only one shadow — a\nlong lower shadow. While similar, noticing their differences is crucial to your\ninterpretation. The long shadow of the hammer extends to the downside off a\nwhite body, while the long shadow of the hanging man extends to the downside\noff a black body. See Figure 8-6 for an example. How can it be a hanging man\nif the body is white? You can tell from the placement among the rising and then\nfalling bars on either side. This is a subtlety that may be easy to miss.\nCHAPTER 8 Redrawing the Price Bar: Japanese Candlesticks 149",

If the\ncandlestick appears in a downtrend, for example, it marks the likely end of the\ntrend even if the real body is white.\nYou may see a hammer in many other contexts, but when it has a white body and\ncomes after a series of black downtrending bars, it implies a reversal. Note that\nthe close is higher than the previous close, too. In this context, the long lower\nshadow means the sellers were able to achieve a new low, but buyers emerged at\nsome point during the day and the close was higher than the open, indicating\nlast-minute buying.\nThe hanging man looks the same except it appears after a series of white uptrend-\ning bars. The long lower shadow marks the bulls’ failure to prevent the bears\nmaking a new low and also from keeping the close below the open. You may see\nthis bar in other places within a series of bars, but when you see it at the top of an\nuptrending series, consider that the trend is probably over. The wise course is to\ntake your profit and run.\nHarami\nA small real-body candlestick that comes after a bigger one is called a harami,\nwhich means “pregnant” in Japanese. A harami (see Figure 8-7) implies that a\nchange in sentiment is impending. Technically, the harami pattern requires two\nbars, so it doesn’t stand alone. On this chart, I show the shadows of the harami bar\nas inside the range of the first big bar, although this isn’t essential to identifying\nthe pattern.\n150 PART 2 Building Indicators from the Ground Up",

If the second session is a doji, the pattern is\ncalled a harami cross. The smaller the real body, the more powerful the implication\nthat a reversal is impending. In Figure 8-7, the white bar in the first session sig-\nnals a likely downward reversal.\nAs I discuss in the section “Sizing Up Emotions” in this chapter, the size of the bar\nis important. Both the exceptionally small harami and the exceptionally big bar\npreceding it express extreme emotion. Seeing just the big white bar after a series\nof smaller ones that are downtrending, you may think that the bulls finally got the\nupper hand, and this movement is the start of an uptrend — especially because\nyou have an indecision doji just ahead of it. But then the small black harami fol-\nlowing the big white bar should disillusion you. If an uptrend was forming, the\nharami just put the kibosh on it.\nTurning to reversal patterns\nReversal patterns number at least 40, and identifying reversals is the one of two\napplications of candlesticks (the other being continuation). The following are\nsome of the most popular and easily identified candlestick reversal patterns.\nBearish engulfing candlestick\nAn engulfing pattern signals the reversal of a trend. The word engulfing refers to the\nopen and close of the bar encompassing a wider range than the open and close of\nthe day before. In Figure 8-8, the engulfing nature is the dominant characteristic\nso that the lower close pops out at you even though the bar also has a higher open.\nWhen a bar starts out at a higher open but then closes at a lower level, the bears\nwon that day. Not shown in Figure 8-8 is a bullish engulfing candlestick, which is\nwhite. The higher close is visually compelling because the real body is so big. Like\nthe harami, the engulfing candlesticks require two bars.\nCHAPTER 8 Redrawing the Price Bar: Japanese Candlesticks 151",

As I discuss in the section “Really long\nshadows” in this chapter, the long upper shadow in an uptrend implies a failure\nof the trend — a failure to close near the high. The addition of the doji bar indi-\ncates traders were already becoming indecisive the day before.\nContinuation patterns\nCandlestick patterns are most often used to identify reversals, but continuation\npatterns do exist. As the name suggests, a continuation pattern gives you confir-\nmation that the trend in place will likely continue. This section covers three con-\ntinuation patterns you may see.\nRising window\nRising window is the term for a gap, in this case, an upward gap. (A downward gap\nis a falling window.) You can get more on gaps in Chapter 7.\nIn Figure 8-9, the gap separates two white candlesticks, which are themselves\nbullish. The next bar doesn’t “fill the gap” (called closing the window). The gap\nbetween the two price bars is confirmation of the existing trend, and the market’s\nrefusal the following day to go back and fill the gap is further confirmation that\nthe trend is okay.\n152 PART 2 Building Indicators from the Ground Up",

In this pattern, note\nthe three large white candlesticks in a row. Seeing the close consistently over the\nopen for three days confirms that the price series is in an uptrend, and the size of\nthe bars indicates its robustness. Three white soldiers is a pattern that has to come\nafter a series of bullish (white) candles to be considered a continuation pattern.\nIt goes by the boring name advance block.\nIn contrast, when three white soldiers comes at the end of a downmove, it’s a\nreversal pattern.

The\nprice series is now in a downtrend. As with three white soldiers, three black crows\nis a continuation pattern when a downmove is already in play and a reversal pat-\ntern when it comes after an upmove.\nCombining Candlesticks with\nOther Indicators\nYou can combine candlesticks with other indicators to get a more-powerful\ndescription of trader sentiment.\nMany traders who don’t act directly on the information contained in the candle-\nstick patterns still use the notation on every chart because of its visual appeal and\nbecause a candlestick bar or pattern often confirms some other indicator to which\nthey give priority.\nFigure 8-10 shows a set of parallel support and resistance lines called a channel\n(which I cover in Chapter 11). You use a channel to outline the probable limit of\nfuture prices moves, either up or down. Note that I describe each of the candle-\nsticks on this chart in preceding sections in this chapter. The harami is followed\nby a rising window (upward gap) and a tall, white candle. These three candlesticks\ntogether are bullish and alert you to go back and start the channel at the lowest\nlow, the bar before the harami.\nFIGURE 8-10:\nCandlesticks as\nconfirmation.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n154 PART 2 Building Indicators from the Ground Up",

The two white candles indicate\nthat the reconsideration of the move on the doji day culminated in traders’ deci-\nsions to keep taking the price up. In this occasion, the doji wasn’t a reversal indi-\ncator, at least not for the next day. After the two white candles comes a bearish\nengulfing candle, a reversal warning that this upmove may be ending. The engulf-\ning candle alerts you to watch the next day’s activity, especially the open, with an\neagle eye.\nYou can also use candlesticks to confirm relative strength, momentum, and many\nother indicators. Check out Chapter 13 for details on relative strength and momen-\ntum. Note that in Japan, a favorite indicator to use with candlesticks is the moving\naverage, which I cover in Chapter 12.\nSome traders use specific candlesticks to identify setups, or a pattern configuration\nthat is believed to have a high probability of delivering a specific outcome. Say that\nafter a long series of falling bars, you see a doji (indicating indecisiveness) or a\nharami that closes near the upper end of the previous candle — and then a bullish\nengulfing candlestick.

But be aware that all bar reading takes practice. Some specific bars and\npatterns of bars are well known — and thus likely to get the expected response\nfrom market participants. But to do a good job interpreting candlesticks, you need\nto understand the dynamic and complex relationships of many patterns all at\nonce, like juggling six oranges rather than three.\nAs with standard bar interpretation, the predictive power of a particular bar or\npattern of bars may be limited to the next day or next few days. Like all technical\nindicators, candlesticks work only some of the time to deliver the expected out-\ncome. Evaluating candlesticks alone, without confirmation from other indicators,\nis a daunting task. First, you have to define carefully what each candlestick looks\nlike.

You still need to understand pat-\ntern recognition, though — don’t count on software to do interpretation\nfor you. You may think that you’d rather have an objective indicator on the chart\ninstead of a subjective pattern, but consider that many traders use nothing but\npatterns and make a good living from it. In addition, because common patterns\nare so widely known and even mentioned in the press and on TV, they can become\nself-fulfilling prophecies.\nTechnical traders have been developing patterns from the earliest days of techni-\ncal analysis. Until personal computers came along, Technical Analysis of Stock Mar-\nket Trends by Edwards and McGee was a Bible for chart readers starting at its\npublication date in 1949. This was the first book that took ideas partly or mostly\ndevised by Charles Dow but written up only in newspapers and magazines. The\ncentral idea is recognizing that after a trend moves up substantially (a primary\ntrend), it pulls back on profit-taking or second thoughts (a secondary trend), and\nthen resumes the upmove. You’ll see this pattern many, many times. Edwards and\nMagee identified support and resistance, gaps, triangles, head-and-shoulders,\nand many other patterns still in wide use today.\nI cover some classic patterns in other chapters, such as the inside day (Chapter 7)\nand support and resistance lines (Chapter 10).

Traders have\ndevised and named literally hundreds of patterns, and you can’t expect to memo-\nrize them all. But master a handful.\nIntroducing Patterns\nChart patterns are indicators consisting of geometric shapes drawn on the chart,\nsuch as a triangle. As with most indicators, a price forecast is embedded in the\npattern identification. Here’s a quick pattern primer:\n» Most patterns employ straight lines (such as triangles), although a few use\nsemicircles (such as head-and-shoulders).\n» Pattern lines generally follow either the highs or the lows.\n» Pattern types are organized according to whether they forecast a continuation\nor a reversal of the current price move, although you can apply many patterns\n(like triangles) either way.\nThe lingo of pattern analysis — double bottom and dead-cat bounce, for\nexample — can be amusing. You also see cup-and-handle, belt-hold, scoop,\nfry-pan, cradle, and jay-hook. Some of the names do seem a little silly, but they\ndescribe the price action efficiently. Nowadays you can have an analyst walk you\nthrough specific patterns on websites like www.candlestickforum.com and You-\nTube, which is especially useful for patterns.

The reason to tolerate the pattern recog-\nnition process is that when you get it right, you have a powerful forecasting tool\nthat can deliver high returns.\n160 PART 3 Finding Patterns\n\n[Page 177]\nUsing imagination\nHumans are awfully good at pattern recognition — are you? Just about every chart\ncontaining at least a month of data offers a pattern or two. At the beginning, you\nwon’t see any patterns at all. After a little practice, you’ll see patterns everywhere,\nincluding some that aren’t there (which is why you need to apply the rules for\nidentifying patterns).\nFor example, consider Figure 9-1. Do you see the pattern?\nFIGURE 9-1:\nFind the pattern.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nThe pattern in Figure 9-1 is a symmetrical triangle, as you can see in Figure 9-2.\nThis pattern is sometimes referred to as a coil. The triangle is characterized by a\nseries of lower highs along which you can draw one trendline and a series of\nhigher lows along which you can draw another trendline. The two lines eventually\ncome together at an apex. Before that point is reached, the price must pierce one\nof the trendlines simply in the course of trading in its normal range. Which one?\nBecause most of the bars are trending downward, you imagine the odds favor a\nbreak to the downside.\nFIGURE 9-2:\nPattern revealed.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nCHAPTER 9 Seeing Patterns 161",

In the Bulkowski study of triangles, the outcome is a downside\nbreakout well over 50 percent of the time, making this triangle a continuation\npattern. But sometimes the breakout is to the upside. In the same study, the price\ndelivered an upside breakout only 43 percent of the time. In this instance, the\npattern forecasts a reversal, not a continuation. Most patterns don’t deliver a gift-\nwrapped buy/sell signal until near the end of the formation. As the symmetrical\ntriangle pattern develops, the forecast is only that a breakout will occur, not the\ndirection of the breakout.\nYou usually see a burst of higher volume when a pattern reaches completion,\nimplying other chartists in the crowd see the same pattern. For triangles, low\nvolume often precedes the breakout and serves as a bonus warning of an impend-\ning move.\nColoring inside the lines\nPattern identification doesn’t require that each single price in a series line up\nperfectly. Not every price high hits an overhead resistance line, for example. It\nsuffices that several hit the line. All triangles — symmetrical, ascending, and\ndescending — incorporate support (top) and resistance (bottom) lines, as do flags\nand pennants, and other patterns. Some analysts say it’s okay for a bar or two to\nbreak one of the lines by a tiny amount.",

But Victor Sperandeo in Trader Vic: Methods\nof a Wall Street Master (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.) — another must-have book in\nevery technical analyst’s library — says that ignoring a break of the trendline is\nalways wrong.\nYou don’t have to trust your pattern recognition ability alone. Curtis Arnold,\nauthor of Timing the Market (Probus Publishing) and Curtis Arnold’s PPS Trading Sys-\ntem (McGraw Hill), recommends using patterns (like triangles) together with\nmoving averages to confirm. PPS stands for pattern profitability strategy.\nCozying Up to Continuation Patterns\nA continuation pattern alerts you when buying or selling pressure is pausing. If a\nbig-picture trend is well-established, the pattern suggests it will accelerate after\nthe pause. A continuation pattern, therefore, is a good place to add more money to\na position, because you expect an additional move in the same direction.

They also often point you to the ideal level at which to place a stop-loss\norder, such as the ascending line in the ascending triangle that I describe in the\nfollowing sections.\nAscending and descending triangles\nTo draw ascending and descending triangles, you draw a line along the highs of a\nprice series and another one along the lows (see Figure 9-3) — just like you do\nwith symmetrical triangles.\nFIGURE 9-3:\nAscending and\ndescending\ntriangles.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nIn the ascending triangle, the price isn’t making new highs, and the topmost\n(resistance) line is horizontal. You may worry that the failure to make new highs\nmeans that the upmove is over. But the price isn’t making new lows, either. You\ncan often expect a breakout of the top line to the upside.\nWhen you can draw a horizontal line along a series of highs, remember to look for\na rising line along the lows at the same time. Not only does the ascending line of\nlows confirm the trend continuation, but it also provides you with a ready-made\nstop-loss level at this ascending support line. The ascending triangle pattern\ndelivers the expected rise about two-thirds of the time (and obviously fails about\none-third of the time). If you wait for prices to close above the top trendline,\nthen the failure rate drops to a mere 2 percent. The expected rise, by the way, is\nequal to the height of the triangle pattern.

In this case\nthe important point is the price is failing to make new lows in the prevailing\ndowntrend. You wonder if the trend is failing. But if you can still draw a line along\nthe series of lower highs, it would be a mistake to buy at this point — the proba-\nbility is high that the downtrend is going to continue.\nDead-cat bounce\nA dead-cat bounce (refer to Figure 9-4) is a peculiar continuation pattern that\nlooks like a reversal at the beginning, with a sizeable upward retracement of a\ndownmove, but then fades back to the same downward direction. Note that a\ndead-cat bounce occurs mostly in downmoves, although there is a less-seen\ninverted dead-cat bounce (see www.thepatternsite.com/idcb.html).\nFIGURE 9-4:\nDead-cat bounce.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nThe dead-cat pattern starts off with a negative fundamental event that triggers a\nmassive downmove. The average size of the downmove is 25 percent — but the\nprice can shoot down by 70 percent or more in only a few days. The bounce is an\nupward retracement that may fool you into thinking the drop is over. The pattern\nincludes a breakaway downside gap about 80 percent of the time, and sometimes\nthe bounce upward fills part of the gap. Many traders mistakenly think that if a\ngap is filled, even partly, the preceding move has ended. The dead-cat bounce is\none of the patterns that disproves that idea — by the end of six months after the\ngap, only a little more than half of price moves close the gap, according to\nBulkowski’s studies.\nThe dead-cat bounce is one of the most successful patterns of all, delivering a\nsuccess rate nearing 90 percent and steady over three decades.\n164 PART 3 Finding Patterns",

No\nmatter how a trend comes to an end, chances are good that a pattern exists to\nidentify it. The reversal patterns I mention in the following sections are definitely\nones you want to be able to recognize.\nDouble bottom\nA double bottom (refer to Figure 9-5) looks like a W. The double bottom is essen-\ntially a retest of a low and predicts a price breakout to the upside, but only under\ncertain conditions.\nFIGURE 9-5:\nDouble bottom.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nThe identification guide for a valid double bottom includes these factors:\n» A minimum of ten days between the two lows and sometimes as long as two\nor three months.\n» Variation between the two lows shouldn’t be more than 4 percent.\n» A center upmove of at least 10 percent from the lower of the two bottoms.\n» The price must rise above the confirmation line to confirm that the pattern\nis indeed a double bottom and the forecast of a continued rise is correct.\nThe confirmation line is a horizontal line drawn from the highest high in the\nmiddle of the W. The point where the price rises above the line is called the\nconfirmation point.\nCHAPTER 9 Seeing Patterns 165",

This is where you buy.\nSome of the price bars break the lines that form the double bottom pattern.\nBreaking some of the bars is allowed in a formation where the line isn’t a support\nor resistance line. Note the pullback, too. A pullback is a retracement to the\ndownside right after the price breaks the confirmation line. A pullback occurs\n68 percent of the time in confirmed double bottoms, making it hard to trust your\npattern identification.\nBulkowski prefers the term throwback for the retracement after an upside break-\nout, as in the double bottom, and pullback for the retracement after a downward\nbreakout, as in a double top, but these words aren’t engraved in stone. You can use\nthe words retracement, correction, throwback, and pullback (more or less)\ninterchangeably.\nNot every twin bottom is a true double bottom. Only about one-third of all the\npatterns that look like a double bottom end up meeting the confirmation criterion.\nIn short, the pattern fails about two-thirds of the time.\nThese odds sound terrible, but wait — on the occasions when you do get confir-\nmation, the double bottom is tremendously reliable. If you wait for the price to\nbreak above the confirmation line, the pattern delivers a profit more than 90 per-\ncent of the time.

For example, one or\nboth of the two lows of the double bottom could be rounded rather than pointed.\nWhen the first bottom is pointed and the second is rounded, Tom Bulkowski\nnames it the Adam and Eve double bottom. You can imagine the other combina-\ntions, including two pointy bottoms (Adam and Adam) and the first one rounded\nwith the second one pointed (Eve and Adam). This is, by the way, as racy as techni-\ncal analysis ever gets.\nOften the two lows of a double bottom are separated by several months and you\ncan easily miss the pattern altogether. Also, minor retracements and other pat-\nterns within the W can obscure the pattern. Some analysts note that big patterns\nlasting months are easier to see on weekly charts that skim off the aberrations in\ndaily data.

In a double top, the price makes a high, pulls back on profit-taking (as usual),\nand then bullish traders try but fail to surpass the first high. The failure to rally a\nsecond time through the first high means that the bulls were beaten and the bears\nare now in charge. A true double top is usually accompanied by falling volume as\nthe second top is being formed.\nAs with the double bottom described earlier, you need to see the price surpass the\nconfirmation level (the lowest point in the center bar of the M) for the pattern to\nbe valid. When that condition is not met, twin tops fail to deliver a sustained\ndownmove more than half the time. When the condition is met, however, the\npattern delivers a downmove more than half the time.\nTopping reversal patterns like the double top are usually more short term than\nbottoming reversal patterns like double bottoms. Tops take less time to form than\nbottoms because traders are more fearful of taking losses after a big gain than\nthey are trusting of early signs of a bottom. Topping reversals are often more\nvolatile, too, although they occur with equal frequency. According to Bulkowski,\nnearly all bottom chart patterns — of any type — perform better than tops.

In equities (but not in securities like foreign\nexchange), buy-side gains are theoretically unlimited while gains on the short\nside are always limited — a stock can’t sell for less than zero.\nThe ultimate triple top:\nHead-and-shoulders\nA triple top or bottom is somewhat rarer than the double version, but the meaning\nis the same — the price fails to surpass the previous low or high, signaling a trend\nreversal.\nThe head-and-shoulders pattern is a triple top that’s easy to see: One bump forms\nthe left shoulder, a higher bump forms a head, and a third bump forms the right\nshoulder. (See Figure 9-6 for two examples.) The head-and-shoulders pattern is\nthe most widely recognized of all the patterns and deserves its popularity because\nwhen the price surpasses the pattern’s confirmation line, it delivers the expected\ndownmove a whopping 90-plus percent of the time.\nCHAPTER 9 Seeing Patterns 167",

The price breaking the neckline predicts a price decline, whether the\nneckline is sloping upward or downward. Seldom do you see the neckline perfectly\nhorizontal. A downward-sloping neckline tends to deliver the biggest price move.\nIf you stop and think about it, a head-and-shoulders pattern is a logical develop-\nment of crowd behavior. A head-and-shoulders usually forms after a long uptrend.\nThe dip from the first shoulder represents the normal retracement after a new\nhigh. The head then represents the triumph of bullish sentiment and sets a new\nhigher high. The dip after the higher-high head represents more profit-taking,\nwhereupon the bulls buy again. When the bulls are making their third try at a\nrally, their price target is the last highest high, which is the top of the head. The\nfailure of the second shoulder to surpass the head is the end of the rally. Buying\ndemand diminishes and selling pressure takes hold, forcing prices down, com-\npleting the pattern.

The bullish version occurs to the bottom of\nthe chart and is called an inverse head-and-shoulders. It’s bullish because after the\nthree bottoms, the price is expected to move to the upside.\nAs with double tops and bottoms, however, some traders refuse to accept the\npattern, and they cause a pullback to the confirmation line on many occasions.\nPullbacks are short-lived, only a week or two, before the security resumes its\ndecline.

The pullback is the only free lunch in technical analysis.\nAs with every trend that is losing steam, volume falls after the head, although\nabout half the time the highest volume is at the left shoulder and about half the\ntime at the head. Volume is low at the second shoulder. Volume on the breakout\nday and the next few days after the breakout day, however, tends to be very high.\nThis isn’t surprising, because by now a great number of chart-oriented traders\nhave identified the pattern and its neckline.

Here\nyou see an already established channel consisting of support and resistance lines.\n(The price is oscillating between the two channel lines.

The measured move down met the price target 55 percent of the time.\nMeasuring from the gap\nA third type of measured move is when you have a gap. A gap is a price bar whose\nhigh or low is separated from the preceding bar by open space, meaning that\nno trades took place at those intervening prices. A gap is important because\nit shows graphically that something happened to alter perception of the security.\nIn Figure 9-7, you measure the distance from the lowest low in the upmove to the\nmiddle of the gap, and then project that height from the middle of the gap to the\nupside (in an uptrend). You do the opposite in a downtrend.\nIn my experience, measured moves in gaps are unreliable, probably because the\ngap itself shows the market for this security has the collywobbles; traders are\nfearful and uncertain and do unexpected things.\nCHAPTER 9 Seeing Patterns 171",

You’re looking for the significant high or low that’s\na turning point in price movement, often named a swing bar. In practice, the trend\nmay continue for a few more bars after the highest high or lowest low — you don’t\nalways get a sharp, clear-cut reversal exactly at a single bar.

Can you mistakenly identify a swing\npoint? You bet.\nIf you look online for “swing bar,” you’ll find many methodologies for identifying\na swing bar. You may begin to wonder if the swing bar isn’t a unicorn — it doesn’t\nexist.

This is so common that\nmost charting software programs have a standard command — “create parallel line”\nor “duplicate.” No one knows why support and resistance lines are so often parallel.\nHere are a few possible explanations:\n• Channel orderliness arises from an orderly trading crowd. Market participants\nknow where the price is relatively high — at the top of the channel. They expect\nno more gains at this point. Die-hard buyers, in turn, see when the price is relatively\ncheap — down around the support line. They buy more, propelling the price\nupward.\n• Many technical analysts perceive a cyclical quality to the ebb and flow of prices\nwithin a channel. Their trading plan relies on the security alternating between\nsupport and resistance. This often works as long as you don’t project the price\nbouncing off support and resistance indefinitely. In other words, don’t get cocky.\n• Humans have an innate need to impose order and patterns. Parallel lines don’t\nalways appear, of course, but they appear often enough that observers speak of\nchannels with a certain air of authority. This kind of parallel support and resistance\nchannel is usually what the commentator has in mind.

But if your\nchart contains a disorderly price move where prices jump around all over the\nplace, the channel is so wide that you can’t judge what is usual or normal.\nWhen you draw a channel so wide or so narrow that only you can see it, you can’t\nexpect other traders to respond to it. To forecast a price range is really to forecast\nthe probable collective behavior of the people who trade the security. The validity\nof a channel depends on other traders in the same security seeing the same thing.\nWhen everyone can see the same lines, a consensus builds as to what constitutes\nbreaking the lines.\nChanneling to make gains and avoid losses\nWith confidence that the channel broadly describes the trend, you can\n» Buy near the channel bottom and sell near the channel top — over and over\nagain, as long as the channel lasts.\n» Estimate your future gain. If the width of the channel is $5 and you bought\nnear a support line, your maximum probable gain over the next few days is\nabout $5 — as long as the channel remains in place and you’re able to sell\nnear the resistance line. This is more useful than you may think at first,\nbecause\n• It’s a sanity check. You can’t reasonably expect a gain that would call for a\nprice far outside the channel.\n• It’s a reality check.

A three-error channel encloses 99 percent of the prices.\nThis usually makes the channel too wide though and blurs your vision of the\ntrend.\n» The linear regression is self-adjusting.

Consider\nthat your car works on scientific principles of internal combustion, but that\ndoesn’t necessarily make you a good driver.\nDealing with Breakouts\nThe breakout is one of the most important concepts in technical analysis. It’s a\ndirect, graphic representation that something happened to change the market’s\nsentiment toward the security. In the simplest terms, a breakout implies that a\ntrend is over, at least in its present form. After a breakout, the price can go up,\ndown, or sideways, but it seldom resumes at exactly the same level and rate of\nchange you had before the breakout.\nA breakout must always be respected, but you want to be sure it’s authentic, which\nis what the following sections are all about.

In addi-\ntion, a breakout can be error or noise.\nDistinguishing between false breakouts\nand the real thing\nYou often see a tiny breakout and don’t know how to evaluate it. Say your support\nline is at precisely $10 and the low of the price bar is $9.50. Is that a legitimate\nbreakout or just an accident? Sometimes you have to accept imperfection and live\nwith ambiguity. The channel lines are an estimate, not a certainty.\nOr sometimes you get a minor break of a channel line that lasts one or two days\nbut then the price returns back inside its channel and performs just as before.

A simple judg-\nment is to see whether the breakout is a violation of the channel line by the close,\nand not just the high or low. As I explain in Chapter 6, the close is the bar compo-\nnent that best summarizes sentiment. A high or a low can be a random aberration,\nor noise. The close is less likely to be random.\nVerifying with volume\nBreakouts are often accompanied by a change in volume, usually an easily noticed\nhigher level. Consulting volume for confirmation is in keeping with interpreting\nevents on the chart in terms of supply and demand. You can verify that the break-\nout isn’t random by seeing an equivalent change in volume:\n» Increase in volume: Extraordinarily high volume on one or two days is\nnamed a volume spike and often accompanies the end of a strong trend, either\na rally or a crash.

You don’t necessarily know what falling volume means, but it may\nforeshadow a breakout. All the people who wanted to sell have done so, and\nthe people still holding an inventory aren’t willing to sell at the current price.\nIt’s like a logjam. It will be broken up when either the bullish camp or the\nbearish camp takes the initiative and causes a new high or new low, with\naccompanying higher volume.\nLooking for clues from other indicators\nWhile the breakout is a powerful technical indicator, you still want as much con-\nfirmation as you can get. Momentum and relative strength are useful to confirm\nor deny that a breakout is real (refer to Chapter 13). A loss of momentum and/or\nrelative strength in an uptrend almost always precedes a downside channel\nbreakout.\nSize matters — and so does duration\nYou can use a filter to estimate whether a breakout is meaningful or can be ignored.\nA filter is a formula or a procedure used to modify an indicator. In this instance,\nthe indicator is the break of the channel line. A filter can modify the amount or\nduration of the breakout. Here’s how you do it:\n» You add some percentage of the total range to the channel line. You stipulate\nthat to constitute a real break of the channel line, the new high or low must\nsurpass this extra amount.\nIf the channel is $5 wide, you can specify that a price high or low has to violate\nthe line by more than 5 percent (or 25 cents).",

Each security has its own habits, or rather, the\npeople who trade it have their collective habits. In one security, the best\nfilter may consistently be 10 percent, and in another it may consistently be\n40 percent. (In the 1930s and 1940s, a filter of 3 percent was standard.) No\nsingle correct filter exists for every security under all circumstances. You only\nknow whether a filter is usable by testing different filters on the price history\nof each security, one by one.\n» Blending works only with coffee. The orderliness of your security can\nchange without warning.

Starting with the median price, you add a factor to get\nupside resistance and subtract a factor to get downside support.\nTo calculate the first (inner) line of resistance, multiply the pivot point value by\ntwo and, from that number, subtract the low of the pivot day. This is named R1. To\ncalculate the first (inner) line of support, or S1, multiply the pivot value by two\nand, from that number, subtract the high of the pivot day. This procedure sounds\nlike a lot of arithmetic, but don’t sweat it. It’s easy enough to do in a spreadsheet\nor by hand, and many trading platforms and websites offer it as a standard option.\nA particularly good one for FX is at www.earnforex.com.

To make a more dynamic (and realistic)\nindicator, you want lines that move along with the price move. Enter the\nmoving average.\nThe moving average is the workhorse of technical analysis. Most traders start out\nin technical analysis with moving averages, and some never see a need to look at\nany other technique. The charts accompanying most commentary usually contain\nmoving averages, despite some whippersnappers dismissing averages as “old\nschool” because moving averages lag. Well, all indicators lag to some extent. Indi-\ncators are constructed from past prices and can hardly do anything but lag.\nA moving average is an arithmetic method of smoothing price numbers so that you\ncan see and measure a trend. A straight line is a good visual organizing device, but\na dynamic line — the moving average — more accurately describes what’s really\ngoing on. In addition, you don’t need to choose starting and ending points, remov-\ning that aspect of subjectivity, although choosing how many periods to put in your\nmoving averages is subjective. In this chapter, I discuss several different ways you\ncan calculate and use moving averages to get buy/sell trading signals.\nMoving averages are trend-following, and so are all indicators that use them. Be\ncareful not to attribute a forecasting capability to the moving average. The moving\naverage is a lagging indicator — it can still rise after a giant fall.\nCHAPTER 12 Using Dynamic Lines 209",

To make the average move, you drop\nthe first day’s data from 10 days back and add today’s to keep the day-count con-\nstant at ten. You can assume that all moving averages use the close unless speci-\nfied otherwise. For example, the moving averages in ichimoku charts use the\nmidpoint price, not the close (refer to Chapter 18 for more discussion about ichi-\nmoku charts).\nAll technical analysis software offers moving average choices. Before PCs, recal-\nculating the moving average every day was a chore. In fact, a preference for the\n10-day average started in the 1930s, because it’s easy to calculate by hand (plus it\nmeasures two weeks), and it remains popular today. Figure 12-1 displays a 10-day\nsimple moving average.\nFIGURE 12-1:\nSimple moving\naverage.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nRight off the bat, you can see that the moving average clings to the prices and\nrepresents their movements better than a straight line and, at the same time,\nsmooths away the occasional erratic price.

Because the average\ncontains data that is x number of days old, like the tenth day in the past in a\n10-day moving average, the average is dragging price history along with it. As the\nnumber rises, you know the newer prices must be higher than the prices were nine\nand ten days ago.\nStarting with the crossover rule\nWhen the price is moving upward or downward, so is the moving average line.\nBecause the moving average lags, the price crosses the average after a turning\npoint. At the V-shaped bottom in Figure 12-1, for example, prices are below the\nline until the gap (ellipse), and then prices cross above the line.\nThe crossover trading rule states that you buy at the point where the price crosses\nabove the moving average line and sell at the point where it falls below the moving\naverage line. In practice, you execute the trades the next day at the open.\nYou can see that the moving average on Figure 12-1 succeeded in capturing the\ntrends. The crossovers captured the trend reversals, too. The result is buying at\nlows and selling at highs. The moving average crossover rule generates a profit.\nWhat could be better? Right about now, you may be tempted to shout “Eureka! I\nhave discovered a systematic, objective trading system.”\nNot so fast.

An outlier is just what it sounds like — a data point that lies\nfar off the trendline represented by the moving average. This particular chart is\ntidy — it has only a pair of outliers. Usually you see a lot more.\nIf you use the crossover rule to buy and sell a security every time the close crosses\nthe moving average, you get a lot of buy/sell signals that reverse in fairly short\norder, as this one does. In this figure, you don’t know at the time that the outliers\nare abnormal. For all you know, the crossover above the moving average is a\ngenuine indication of a reversal. You know only after the price resumes the down-\nmove that they were outliers.\nTable 12-1 shows the gains and losses following the moving average crossover\ntrading rule.

In moving average work, the false signal is a crossover that\nreverses within a few days, like the outliers in Figure 12-1. False signals usually\nreverse fairly quickly, putting you back in the trade in the right direction, but\nin the meanwhile, you take a loss, called a whipsaw loss. Whipsaw refers to the\nwhipping action of the price quickly moving through the moving average in both\ndirections, resulting in a series of back-and-forth trades. Whipsaws occur in even\nthe best-behaved trend and are common in a sideways market.\nWhipsaws have a pernicious effect on your profit and loss statement in two ways:\n» When trading a trend-following technique like the moving average crossover,\nyou make most of your gains by riding big trends, and you accept that\ngains are going to be reduced by the occasional whipsaw at reversal points,\nsideways periods, and any spiky outlier.

In all the cases in this chapter,\nI’m conveniently not subtracting commissions and fees, but remember that\nthey reduce profits and raise losses in real life.\nFiltering out whipsaws\nInstead of using the crossover of price and moving average alone to generate a\nbuy/sell signal, you can set up additional tests, called filters. If the crossover passes\nthe filter tests, chances are it’s a valid buy/sell signal and not a flash in the pan.\nFilters come in several varieties, and you can apply any or all of them to reduce the\nnumber of trades. Note that filters may delay entry and exit to an already-lagging\nindicator and thus reduce total gains. Increasing the lag is a fairly high price to\nreduce whipsaw losses, but if you’re seriously averse to loss, a filter may be just\nthe ticket.\nConsider the following filters:\n» Time: The close has to remain above (or below) the moving average for an\nadditional x number of periods after the crossover date.\n» Extent: The price has to surpass the moving average numerical value by x\npercent of the price or x percent of some other measure, such as the trading\nrange of the past y days.

At some later point down the road, a better one might be 13 days, or 23.\n218 PART 4 Dynamic Analysis\n\n[Page 235]\nOne moving average really does stand out — the 20-day. When a security is trend-\ning, the 20-day moving average often works the same way a support line works —\nsellers stop selling when it’s reached. Less often, the 20-day moving average\nconstitutes resistance. The virtue of a moving average that works as support or\nresistance is that you don’t have to choose a starting and ending point — the\nmoving average is nonjudgmental and everyone gets the same line. Many traders\nplot the 20-day moving average on every chart to get a feel for what other traders\nin the market may see as a benchmark level.\nFOLKLORE VERSUS TRADING TOOLS\nYou see reports that Blue Widget stock just surpassed its 50-day moving average, or its\n200-day moving average, or that its 50-day moving average crossed its 200-day moving\naverage, a so-called golden cross. This type of information may or may not be interesting\nand useful. Maybe the price had been within a few pennies of the 200-day moving aver-\nage for months on end and just managed to inch over it. Why is this news?\nWithout a context, a price crossing a moving average of a fixed number of days is just\nanother statistic. Because of research by technical trader Richard Donchian, the 5-day\nand 20-day moving averages became popular, and that makes sense — 5 days is a week\nand 20 days is (roughly) a month. But 50 days and 200 days are just round numbers\nunrelated to the calendar (the number of business days in a year is about 240).",

And as\nI note in this chapter, the best number of days to put in a moving average is the smallest\nnumber that still generates as few whipsaws as possible. By choosing a number as high\nas 50 or 200 days, you’re condemning yourself to an inefficient parameter practically by\ndefinition.\nBut that would be to mistake a barometer of the environment for a trading tool. If you’re\nlooking for an indicator to describe the general tone of a security or market index, the\n200-day moving average is pretty good — mostly because it has been in vogue for\ndecades. To use a fixed number like 50 or 200 makes sense only if everyone else is look-\ning at the same number, and increasingly, they are. Even people who profess to dislike\nand distrust technical analysis give credence to the 200-day moving average.\nBut what exactly does it mean? Well, the 200-day moving average doesn’t have a proven\nmeaning. A security whose price falls below the 200-day moving average has fallen out\nof favor with traders, and one whose price is in the process of crossing above the 200-\nday moving average is in favor. The financial press sometimes reports a death cross, or\nthe 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day. Death cross is a semantically\nloaded term that has no statistical basis for reliably predicting outcomes. This technical\njargon example is an instance where language influences the outcome far more than\nthe event the language is purportedly describing.\nCHAPTER 12 Using Dynamic Lines 219",

You may see SMA and wonder what that is.\nSMA stands for the simple moving average (and you feel like an idiot after you fig-\nure it out).

Don’t let the arithmetic put you off your\nfeed. Modifying moving averages is a proven method of raising their effectiveness\n(that is, profitability).",

And it’s not as though you have to do the math yourself —\nyour software will do it for you.\nWeighted and exponential moving averages\nInstead of reducing the number of days in the moving average, a different way to\nmake the moving average more responsive to the latest prices is to weight the lat-\nest prices more heavily. You get the weighted moving average by multiplying each\nprice in your series according to how fresh it is. In a five-day moving average, for\nexample, the price on Day 5 (today) would be multiplied by 5, Day 4 by 4, Day 3 by\n3, and so on. Remember to divide the total by the sum of the weights, not the sum\nof the days (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15).\nMore popular than the weighted moving average is the exponential moving average.\nThis moving average is hard to calculate, and fortunately, all the charting soft-\nware and websites do it for you. The principle is to create a factor that minimizes\nthe change between the existing moving average and the latest price, creating a\nsmaller bridge than the simple moving average, which has to bridge the entire\ndistance between today’s price and yesterday’s.\n220 PART 4 Dynamic Analysis",

The fewer the number of days\nin the moving average, the bigger the factor.\nAdaptive moving averages\nThe adaptive moving average works like a long-term moving average in that it\ndiminishes the effect of outliers, but without sacrificing sensitivity to trended-\nness. You always want a moving average to be as short as possible to identify the\nbeginning of a trend quickly, but as long as necessary to avoid whipsaw losses.\nIn other words, sometimes you want the moving average to contain a small num-\nber of days, and other times you want it to contain a higher number of days. You\ndon’t want to be forced to select the number yourself because you have no way of\nknowing in advance which is right. You want some automatic mechanical adjust-\nment to kick in when variability changes, to adapt the moving average to the new\ncondition. You can’t change the number of days according to conditions, but you\ncan get the same effect by making the moving average adaptive.\nSoftware today contains many versions of adaptive moving averages, generally\nsome form of detrending. Detrending the series makes the current price more\nimportant; you simply subtract the current price from the moving average. This\nsmooths the line right away.",

Other adjustments can get horribly complex.\nTrading systems designer Perry Kaufman devised an ingenious way to achieve this\nadaptiveness for trading purposes and called it the adaptive moving average. It’s\nabbreviated KAMA, for Kaufman’s adaptive moving average, while other versions of\nthe adaptive moving average are usually named just AMA or have the inventor’s\ninitial, like Richard Jurik’s JAMA and Alan Hull’s HMA. The aim of all adaptive\nmoving averages is to reduce lag while not sacrificing the smoothness of the aver-\nage. To see the arithmetic behind the adaptiveness, search on the Internet for\n“adaptive moving average.” You’ll get plenty of hits, including the observation at\nwww.investopedia.com that research shows adaptive moving averages don’t add\nall that much, but are still useful when used with other indicators.\nWild and woolly moving averages\nIn 1960 Chester Keltner devised a classic moving average system in How to Make\nMoney in Commodities (Keltner Statistical Service). It starts with a 10-day moving\naverage of the high, low, and close, with a channel on either side made from the\n10-day moving average of the high-low range.

Hutson is the\nauthor of Charting the Stock Market, The Wyckoff Method (Technical Analysis, Inc.).\nThe TRIX process is too complicated and lengthy to discuss here, but it entails a\nsmoothing constant that has the effect of suppressing minor-change prices and\nemphasizing big-change prices. TRIX removes a great deal of the lag inherent in\nthe moving average and works more like a momentum indicator than a regular\nmoving average (see Chapter 13 for more on momentum).\nAs you should have started figuring out by now, moving averages are a fertile field\nfor plowing by the computationally ingenious.\nChoosing a moving average type\nTraders debate which type of moving average is the best.

The weighted\nmoving average is the most sensitive to the latest price moves, followed by the\nexponential moving average. Notice that the KAMA is the best at chopping off the\nspiky outlier prices that make the price series noisy. That means it works best at\nreducing whipsaw losses, too. But it gives a value of zero to the breakaway gap like\nthe last bar on this chart. In a trend reversal like the one depicted on this chart,\nthat’s a drawback. You enter the new trend later than if you used a nonadaptive\ntechnique, but as a reward, you don’t get many false signals.\nDon’t invest the moving average with supernatural powers. It’s only arithmetic. A\nmoving average can’t capture every important move and, in fact, rides roughshod\nover some important chart events, like breakaway gaps. The moving average is a\nrepackaging of the price series, not the price series itself.\nUsing Multiple Moving Averages\nYou like a short moving average because it responds quickly to new conditions,\nand you like a long moving average because it reduces errors. So why not use both\nof them? Or three — a short-, medium-, and long-term moving average? You can,\nand the following sections can help you.\nPutting two moving averages into play\nInstead of looking for the price to cross a single moving average, you look for a\nshorter moving average (say 5 days) to cross a longer moving average (say 20\ndays).",

Before getting\ninto how to customize the two moving average model, look at Figure 12-4, which\nshows the same security and time frame as in Figure 12-1, only this time with two\nmoving averages, the short one at 5 days and the longer one at 20 days.

But you can also see that the outlier problem on the first\nchart is absent from this chart. The outlier is still there, but the short-term\nmoving average is clearly below the long-term moving average, so you don’t care.\nYou hardly see it. On the right-hand side of the chart, some prices close below the\nshort-term moving average, and again, you don’t care. The short-term moving\naverage remains nicely above the long-term one, and in fact, you can see a fair\namount of daylight between the two moving average lines.\nThe more open space — daylight — you see between two moving averages, the\nmore confident you can be that the signal is correct and will continue.

For example, you could\nplot the 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day moving averages on a chart, and you would\nconsider a buy/sell signal to be confirmed only when both the 5-day and the\n10-day cross the 20-day moving average.

But the crossover\nis a blunt instrument. You can often see a crossover coming, but if you’re follow-\ning rule-based discipline, you’re impatiently waiting for the actual crossover.\nIf you look at any two moving average crossovers, you see that at a turning point,\nthe short moving average converges to the price and the long-term moving aver-\nage converges, a bit later, to the short-term one. When two things converge, they\nget closer together. By the time the crossover actually occurs, the price peak (or\ntrough) has already passed.\nCHAPTER 12 Using Dynamic Lines 227",

To calculate\nconvergence and divergence, you simply subtract the long-term moving average\nfrom the short-term one. That sounds backward, but stop and think about it for a\nminute. If the price and moving averages are rising, the long-term moving aver-\nage is a smaller number, say $10, than the shorter-term moving average, say $15.\nThe short average minus the long average equals $5.

Momentum\nis the single best tool for doing that. Momentum is the speed of a price\nchange and it’s just about the easiest indicator of all — you divide today’s price by\nthe price x number of days ago. Over time, if the price is rising at a good clip, the\nmomentum number keeps getting bigger, and so a graphic representation on the\nchart shows a rising line. Momentum refers to the change in the price level rather\nthan the level itself. Arithmetically, prices can still be rising but if they’re rising at\na slower pace, the line flattens out. When prices start falling, the momentum\nnumber gets smaller and smaller, and so the line on the chart is a falling line.\nThat’s basic momentum. But it gets more complicated than the original simple\nformula. For one thing, you want to measure acceleration and deceleration and\nnot just eyeball it on the chart. Measuring is named rate-of-change and delivers\nnumbers. In addition, you want to get rid of noise and want to see momentum in\nthe context of the price range. Some more arithmetic is going to be needed.\nMomentum can come in some interesting packages. Think about the moving\naverage convergence-divergence (MACD) indicator in Chapter 12 — all its raw\nmaterial consists of moving averages, but in the end, what you get is a depiction\nof how the price is changing. Therefore, MACD is really a momentum indicator.\nMost momentum indicators were designed to evaluate the strength of a trend\nalready identified by other indicators, such as the moving average crossover (refer\nto Chapter 12) or slope of a standard error channel (see Chapter 11).

How can any number\nbased on past prices be leading? It can’t. And yet traders, acting as a group,\nrespond in reliably predictable ways to certain stimuli. When traders are using a\nmomentum indicator to identify an overbought/oversold condition and a majority\nof traders judge that the overbought/oversold criterion has been met, you can\nexpect them to obey the trading rule embedded in the criteria. If the security is\ndeemed overbought by a momentum indicator, traders will sell. If it’s deemed\noversold by a momentum indicator, traders will buy. It’s astonishing how often\nmomentum indicators turn out to be right in calling a trend reversal long before\nother indicators. But beware a mystical interpretation! Momentum identifies\nwhen the crowd is becoming more bullish, and traders naturally want to join the\ncrowd. Momentum identifies when bullish sentiment is decelerating and traders\nwant to protect themselves against a possible pending loss.

In physics and\nclassical Newtonian mechanics, momentum has a specific mathematical defini-\ntion and can be measured with precision. In technical analysis, sometimes that\nprecision is mistakenly transferred to the human behavior behind price moves.\nAt its most simple, momentum is mass times velocity (think of a truck accelerat-\ning down a hill — it will take a big wall or countervailing force to stop it). But\nmarket prices aren’t physical objects, whether atomic particles, billiard balls, or\nrunaway trucks. Metaphors that make market prices comparable to physical\nobjects — mass might be viewed as volume traded, for example — are still meta-\nphors, not scientific measurements.\nMany top writers and system designers are engineers who transfer concepts and\nformulas wholesale from their fields.

A runaway truck can be stopped by specific and measurable\nmechanical means. The only mechanical way to halt a runaway price series is to\nclose down the exchange on which the security is trading.\nIn addition, price momentum can be changed, and dramatically, by a one-time\nexternal event (flash crash in the index, war, and so on). That’s the point of a\nshock — you don’t know it’s coming ahead of time and you don’t know what\ninfluence it will have on prices. (Chapter 3 discusses these contingencies.) A flock\nof birds flying into an airplane will affect momentum in a specific and measurable\nway.

This is the same lookback period\nI talk about in the chapter on moving averages (Chapter 12). You can choose any\nlookback period when calculating momentum indicators. In this section, I use\n5 days, but you usually see 12 or 14 days — the standard parameter used in most\nsoftware. Why 12 or 14 and not 10 or 15 (two or three trading-day weeks)? Because\nthe inventors of these indicators found 12 or 14 to be the most efficient lookback\nperiod.\nAlthough you can use the subtraction method, whereby you subtract today’s price\nfrom the price some number of periods ago, today nearly everyone uses the\nmethod of dividing today’s price by the price x periods ago.\nIn Figure 13-1, the momentum indicator using the division method crosses into\nnegative territory (meaning that the latest price is lower than the price five days\nbefore) and does the crossover one day before the price opens gap down (see\nChapter 7 on gaps). A little later the momentum indicator reaches the positive-\nnegative line but fails to hold it for longer than a day. Finally, momentum crosses\nabove the line while the price is still falling. But sure enough, momentum\naccurately forecasted a price rise. Three days later, the price matches a previous\nhigh and breaks out to the upside.\nCHAPTER 13 Measuring Momentum 235",

Here’s one calculation\nmethod (of many available):\n1.\nToday’s close minus the close x days ago\n2.\nDivide the result in Step 1 by the close x days ago\n3.\nMultiply the result in Step 2 by 100.\nThe result is information presented in context rather than just the difference\nbetween the two prices. If today’s price is equal to the price five days ago, the\nresult now reads 100, meaning that the new price is equal to 100 percent of the\nprice five days ago, which is the same as saying that there is zero change between\nthe two prices.\nStop and think about the arithmetic for a minute. In simple momentum, you\nmeasure how fast you’re going, assume $1 per day. If today the price is $15 and\nfive days ago it was $10, the momentum value is 15/10, or 1.5. Now add another\nday’s worth of price data at the constant speed of $1/day. The simple momentum\nindicator yields 16/11, or $1.45.

Momentum investing, on the other hand, entails buying a\nsecurity just because it’s going up without actually measuring the rate of change or\nconsidering any other factors. The idea behind momentum investing is that a security\nthat’s already rising will continue to rise at least a little longer. This idea sounds like\nDow Theory — prices move in trends — but it’s incomplete and gives people the\nwrong idea about the meaning of the word momentum to real technical traders.\nIn the late 1990s, momentum stocks included Internet, telecom, and high-tech stocks\nthat rose on the exuberance of the crowd to valuations many times any reasonable\nestimate of value. A momentum strategy came to be summed up in the phrase: “If it’s\nrising, buy it.”\nHowever, to buy a security just because it’s rising isn’t momentum-based technical\nanalysis because the momentum trader has no systematic entry and exit criteria. To\nhijack a hot-button word like momentum is a silly effort to dress up an undisciplined\napproach to trading and obscures a really important use of momentum, using the\nrelative momentum of two or more securities (named comparative relative strength)\nto pick the one that has the best chance to deliver a gain.",

The next day, assuming the same $1 rise, you get\n16/11 = 1.45 divided by 16 = 0.0909 times 100 = 9.09 percent. The numbers are\ndifferent but the conclusion is the same — the price may be rising, but it’s not\naccelerating. In fact, it’s decelerating, and by making the indicator a percentage\nchange, you’re measuring the rate of deceleration. Yesterday, when the price was\nat $15, momentum was 10 percent and now it’s 9.09 percent. Ah, momentum is\nfalling by about 1 percent. This is a more useful number than $1.45.\nThe momentum indicator can move up or down only if the price is accelerating or\ndecelerating.

Momentum sometimes mirrors the price move. This reflection is\nbecause, like a moving average, the momentum indicator is tracking the close\nrelative to the close a certain number of days back. The more days you put in your\nlookback period, the smoother the momentum line. Unlike the moving average,\nmomentum doesn’t include all the closes of the days in-between, and by omitting\nthat extraneous information, you get a smoother line.\nHowever, if you have a one-day price spike, you may see a jump in momentum,\nbut ten days later you’re going to see a sudden drop in the momentum indicator,\ntoo, as that spike gets excluded from the data series. This type of situation is when\nit pays to look at the price bars and not just the indicator. If the spike was a one-\nday anomaly, the information you think you’re getting from momentum can be\nmisleading.\nMomentum isn’t a trend indicator like a moving average, and yet it seems to track\nthe trend.

Therefore, you could shorten the number of days in\nthe comparison from ten to (say) three. A three-day momentum indicator is more\nsensitive, but it also crosses the zero/100 line repeatedly when the price isn’t\ntrending, or is trending only slightly, generating small whipsaw losses. You can\nalso get whipsaw losses when the price is only putting in a small pullback and not\nreversing at all.\nCHAPTER 13 Measuring Momentum 239",

Instead of making the\nzero/100 line the buy/sell rule, you can dictate that the indicator has to rise (say)\n2 percent over the zero/100 line for a buy and fall 2 percent under it for a sell. You\ncan also delay accepting the buy/sell signal for one or more days. You can backtest\nboth kinds of filters by using historical data.\nDepending on the security, upmoves and downmoves aren’t ordinarily symmetri-\ncal in size, duration, or speed. Sometimes your security has upmoves that\naccelerate strongly but decelerate in a sloppy, slow manner. Remember, every\nsecurity has its own habits.\nFor instance, if a security usually delivers a momentum reading of plus 130 to\nminus 130, this reading means that the price tends to speed up or slow down by\nnot more than 30 percent over the course of any 10-day period.

Sometimes you\ncan see an eerie regularity in the momentum indicator, especially in longer time\nframes (like weekly and monthly data).\nApplying Momentum\nThe trading rule for momentum is simple: Buy when the indicator crosses above\nthe zero line and sell when it crosses below the zero line. The zero line is the level\nat which the current price is equal to the price x number of days ago. When the\nmomentum indicator crosses above zero, the price trend is upward, and the indi-\ncator is signaling you to buy. When it crosses below zero, the trend is downward,\nand the indicator is signaling you to sell.\nHowever, because momentum measures the rate of change and not the price\nitself, it has some peculiar properties, which I discuss in the following sections.\nDiscovering divergence\nMomentum can be a confusing indicator, because your eye is accustomed to inter-\npreting a line that is pointing upward as having to do with the dollar value. But in\nthis case, this upward line refers only to the speed of the price change.

Divergence also refers to momentum\nhigher or lower, but less high or low than a previous peak or trough, while the\nprice trend is making a new higher high or lower low. Technically, they’re both\ngoing in the same direction, so it’s a misnomer to call it a divergence, but when\nmomentum falls proportionately short of the price move, you can think of it as a\nfailure to confirm.\nFIGURE 13-2:\nMomentum and\nprice divergence.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nIn Figure 13-2, the price is making a series of new highs, but about midway\nthrough the rise, momentum stops making new highs and starts going in the\nother direction. Then it flattens, meaning that the new price gains aren’t as robust\nas the older price gains. Notice that momentum crosses the buy/sell midline on\nthe very next day after the highest price high. Here is an ideal case for using\nmomentum as a buy/sell indicator in its own right. To sell when momentum\ncrosses the buy/sell line, you exit near the peak.\nVolume can be a useful adjunct to momentum-price divergence. As I note in\nChapter 11 regarding breakouts, as a price trend is peaking, you usually see an\nabnormal rise in volume. A volume spike often foreshadows the end of a strong\ntrend.

For that reason, traders use RSI more often as a confirming\nindicator, while they use other indicators to obtain the buy/sell signal.\nIn the following sections, I outline how you can do the RSI math and visualize it\non a chart. Plus, you can also discover some of the nuances of using the RSI.\nCalculating the RSI\nThe RSI measures the relative speed of price changes. The RSI uses averages over\nseveral days rather than single price points. However, it uses the ratio method,\nlike momentum. To calculate RSI, you first calculate relative strength (RS) over a\nspecific number of days. The calculation looks like this:\nRS Average of Close Previous Close on Up Days Average of Previous Close\nCurrent Close on Down Days\nRSI 100 100/ 1 RS\nReversing the order of Close/Previous Close on Down Days eliminates negative\nnumbers and delivers absolute values. This arithmetic process creates an oscillator\nthat is limited to a range of zero to 100. When the indicator is at or near zero, it\nmeans that the security is fully oversold. When it’s at 100, the security is\noverbought.\nAn oscillator is the result of converting the highest and lowest numerical values of\nan indicator to +100 for the highest and –100 (or zero) for the lowest, so that you\ncan see when price changes are nearing extremes and thus identify overbought or\noversold conditions.\nThe RSI and most oscillators rarely go all the way to zero or 100 percent, but rather\nvary between the 30 and 70 percent mark of the entire range.",

In some instances,\nyou may find that the 20 to 80 percent mark is better, or even 10 to 90 percent.\nThe RSI, like most oscillators, is limited by one of its arithmetic components, the\nhigh-low range over x periods. You may have a 75-day uptrend, for example, that\nhas five or six sell signals generated by an RSI that is using 14 days as the base\nrange.

Momentum also turns down, but it doesn’t\ncross the center sell line for another two weeks. The RSI then falls to the bottom\nof its range at an index reading of 30 percent.\nBecause you’re using averages, the indicator has a normal range of between 30\nand 70 percent of the maximum range, although touches of the maximum\nextremes do occur as follows:\n» Overbought: When the RSI is at or over the 70 percent level, the security is\nconsidered overbought. As I describe in Chapter 2, an overbought condition\nis when the security has moved by what traders in that security consider an\nextreme, so traders want to take profit. You can automatically sell when the\nsecurity becomes overbought (when it crosses the 70 percent line), or you\ncan use the line as a confirming indicator with other indicators.\nIn Figure 13-3, using the crossover of the 70 percent line as a sell signal in its\nown right is the correct trading action.\n» Oversold: When RSI hits the 30 percent level, the security is considered\noversold.

That’s\nbecause the price was making new lows, but the 14-day average downmove\nwas getting smaller each day — the downmove was decelerating. In this\ninstance, the RSI was giving a premature signal and it would’ve been better\nto consider crossing the oversold line as a warning rather than a sell signal.\nWhen trends are strong, securities can remain overbought or oversold for long\nperiods. However, a divergence between the price and the indicator is a warning\nsign that the price move may be coming to an end. In Figure 13-3, for example, the\nRSI serves as a sell signal at the overbought level, but doesn’t provide an equally\nclear buy signal when it first meets the oversold level. Instead of reversing smartly,\nthe RSI indicator meanders down around the oversold line for several weeks. So,\non one occasion it’s a buy/sell signal, and on the next occasion, it’s a warning.\nIn the place on the chart in Figure 13-3 between the overbought and oversold\nareas, the indicator is going sideways near the 30 percent line and the price is still\nfalling. By analyzing the internal dynamics of the price (the ratio of average up days\nto average down days), the RSI indicator tells you not to sell the security short at\nthis point, even though the price is still falling, because it is about to reverse to an\nupmove.

Again, the RSI peaks on the same day as the\nprice high. Notice that momentum peaks a week earlier, but it hasn’t crossed the\nbuy/sell centerline before the chart ends.\nFiltering RSI\nTushar Chande, author of The New Technical Trader and Beyond Technical Analysis\n(John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), has probably done more tinkering with momentum\nindicators than anyone else on the planet. The Chande momentum oscillator\ncalculates the difference between the sum of all recent gains and the sum of all\nrecent losses and then divides the result by the sum of all price movement over the\nperiod, with a default period of 20 days. The oscillation range is plus-100 to\nminus-100. The security is considered overbought when the indicator is above\nplus-50 and oversold when it’s below minus-50. Most software packages apply a\nnine-day moving average to act as a buy/sell signal line.\nThe Chande momentum indicator differs from the RSI because it includes up\nand down days in both the numerator and denominator (hence the need for\nminus-100). By refining the strength of a move against all price movement over\nthe period, a strong upmove appears earlier than in RSI and likewise, a strong\ndownmove appears sooner, too. This may be only a day or two, but hey, a day or\ntwo can mean a lot.\nCHAPTER 13 Measuring Momentum 245",

Larry Connors and Linda Raschke recommend it\nin Street Smarts: High Probability Trading Strategies for the Futures and Equity Markets\n(M. Gordon Publishing Group). This filter is fairly complex, so hang on to your hat.\nYou start with what Wilder named “average directional movement,” defined as Plus\nDirectional Movement (+DM) when the current high minus the prior high is greater\nthan the prior low minus the current low. You get a Minus Directional Movement (−DM)\nwhen the prior low minus the current low is greater than the current high minus the\nprior high. Note that in both calculations, a negative number is considered a zero. ADX\nis really a trend filter rather than a momentum filter, but it serves the same purpose —\nto filter out minor pullbacks.\nAnother Chande momentum indicator is named Aroon, meaning dawn in Sanskrit.\nAroon comes in two lines, one depicting how many periods since the most recent\nhigh (the up line) and one measuring how many periods since the most recent low\n(the down line), generally over 20 periods and both converted to an index basis.\nWhen Aroon Up is over 70 and staying there, the uptrend is okay.

Aroon is meant to be a confirming\nindicator, but you could also use the crossover of the two lines to signal buy or sell.\nUsing the Rest of the Price Bar:\nThe Stochastic Oscillator\nA lot can be going on in other parts of the price bar, such as closes near the high\nversus closes near the low. When the close is near the high and each high is higher\nthan the day before, you not only have an uptrend, but an uptrend that is acceler-\nating. In a rally, you expect prices to close near the high of the daily high-low\nrange. In a sell-off, you expect the price to close near the low of the daily high-\nlow range.\nTwo relationships are particularly important: The high-low range over x number\nof days, and the relationship of the close to the high or the low over the same\nx number of days.

The good news: %K and %D appear only in the stochastic oscillator\nand aren’t used anywhere else in technical analysis.\nStep 1: Putting a number to\nthe fast stochastic %K\nThe %K indicator takes the difference between today’s close and the lowest low of\nthe past five days and divides that by the widest high-low range of the past five\ndays. I discuss this normalization formula in Chapter 12. The ratio is then multi-\nplied by 100 to make it an oscillator that ranges between 0 and 100, again with a\nnormal spread between 30 and 70 percent or from 20 to 80 percent.

Arithmetically, therefore,\ntoday’s %K is a higher number than yesterday’s, and the line on the chart has to\nrise, as follows:\n%K Current Close Lowest Low Highest High Lowest Low 1000\nBut here’s a brainteaser: What about the case in which the high-low range over the\npast five days is $5 to $12 and today’s price is $12? If today’s close is $12, the highest\nhigh, the top part (numerator) of the ratio is today’s close ($12) minus the lowest\nlow, $5, or $7, exactly the same as the five-day range, or the bottom part of the\nratio (denominator).

Both concepts of volatility are valid and\nuseful. The higher the volatility, the higher the risk — and the opportunity.\nA change in volatility implies a change in the expected price range yet to come. A\nvolatile security offers a wide range of possible outcomes. A nonvolatile security\ndelivers a narrower and thus more predictable range of outcomes. The main rea-\nson to keep an eye on volatility is to adjust your profit targets and your stop loss\nto reflect the changing probability of gain or loss.\nIn this chapter, I describe three ways you can measure volatility and discuss their\nvirtues and drawbacks. Then I describe the most popular way traders incorporate\nconsideration of volatility into their trading plans — the Bollinger Band. I also\nintroduce another kind of band — the average true range band.\nVolatility comes in two flavors, historical and implied. Historical volatility refers\nto price variations in the recent past, and that is what I describe in this chapter.\nImplied volatility is a different kettle of fish. Implied volatility is a term used in\noption analysis and not covered in this book.\nCHAPTER 14 Estimating Volatility 253",

Just about everybody uses the word volatility incorrectly from a statistician’s\nviewpoint — and even statisticians squabble over definitions. To the mathemati-\ncally inclined trader, volatility usually refers to the standard deviation of price\nchanges (see the “Considering the standard deviation” section). Standard devia-\ntion isn’t the only measure of volatility, but it suffices for most technical analysis\npurposes. In general usage, volatility means variance, and that’s how I use it in\nthis chapter.\nVariance is a statistical concept that measures the distance of each bar between the\nhigh and low from the mean (such as a moving average). You calculate variance by\ntaking the difference between the high or low from the average, squaring each\nresult (eliminating the minus signs), adding them up, and dividing by the number\nof data points. Squaring magnifies wildly aberrant prices, so the bigger the varia-\ntion from the average and the more instances of such big variations in any one\nseries, the higher the volatility.\nTraders don’t use variance as a stand-alone measure or indicator, and it’s not\noffered in most charting packages. Why? Because variance isn’t directly useful as\na separate measure from the standard deviation, which is essentially the square\nroot of variance. Don’t panic at the thought of square root or any other statistical\nmeasure in technical analysis.",

Your software will supply the indicators that incor-\nporate variance, and you don’t have to know how to calculate the indicators in\norder to use them effectively.\nTime frame is everything. How you perceive volatility depends entirely on the\ntime frame you’re looking at. Failure to specify a specific time frame is why you\nsee so many conflicting generalizations about volatility. The period over which\nyou measure volatility has a direct effect on how you think about volatility and,\ntherefore, what kind of a trader you are. Your trading style isn’t only a function of\nwhat indicators you like, but also of how you perceive risk. Two traders can use\nthe same indicators but get different results because they manage the trade dif-\nferently by looking at volatility differently (scaling in and out, choosing a stop-\nloss level, and so on).\nIn Figure 14-1, your eye tells you that the low-variance prices on the left side of\nthe chart are less volatile and therefore less risky to trade than the high-variance\nprices on the right side of the chart, even when the high-variance prices are in a\ntrending mode. And that’s the point about volatility — it describes the level of\nrisk. High variance means high risk.

Volatility rises when traders get\nexcited about a new move. They anticipate taking the price to new highs or lows,\nwhich arouses greed in bulls putting on new positions and fear in bears, who\nscramble to get out of the way in a cascade of stop losses. The start of a new move\nis when you get higher highs (or lower lows). Volatility tends to be abnormally low\njust before a turning point and abnormally high just as the price is taking off in\nthe first big thrust of a new trend. It’s also, however, a sad fact of trading life that\nsometimes volatility is high or low for no price-related reason you can find. (Refer\nto Chapter 4 for more about this pesky noise.)\nHigh volatility means trading is riskier but has more profit potential, while low\nvolatility means less immediate risk.\nVolatility isn’t inherently good or bad. Stability of volatility over time is a good\nthing because it allows you to estimate maximum potential gains and losses with\ngreater accuracy. Every security has its own volatility norm that changes over\ntime as the fundamentals and trader population changes.

As the price series begins, you instantly see an upward trend.\nYour ability to see the trend is due in part to the orderliness of the move. You see\nthe trend, not variations away from it.\nA trending security with low volatility offers the best trade because it has a high\nprobability of giving you a profit and low probability of delivering a loss. It’s also\neasier on the nerves. Here’s why low volatility means the best trade:\n» You can project the price range of a low-volatility trending security into the\nfuture with more confidence than a high-volatility security.\n» You generally hold a low-volatility trending security for a longer period of time,\nreducing trading costs such as brokerage commissions.\nLow volatility without trending\nA security that’s range-trading sideways with little variation from one day to the\nnext is simply untradeable in that time frame. You have no basis on which to form\nan expectation of a gain, and without an expectation of gain, you shouldn’t trade\nit. You can reduce the time frame (from one day to one hour, for example) to make\nvisible and tradeable the minor peaks and troughs.\nIf a price is trading sideways without directional bias but the high-low range of\nthe bars contracts or widens, now you’re cooking with gas.

When it’s\nrange-trading with high volatility, it’s a horrible nightmare. The right section of\nthe price series in Figure 14-1 shows this. In this situation, the range is so wide\nyou can’t identify a breakout; you see spiky one- and two-day reversals as bulls\nand bears slug it out, making it hard to find entries or to set systematic stops.\nThe solution to high volatility in a nontrending case is to stop trading the security\nor to narrow the time frame down to an intraday time frame. Often you can find\ntradeable swings within 15-minute or 60-minute bars that don’t exist on the daily\nchart.\nMeasuring Volatility\nVolatility is the degree of variation of a price series over time. You can measure\nvolatility in plain or fancy ways. In financial analysis, volatility usually means one\nthing — the standard deviation, which I discuss in the “Considering the standard\ndeviation” section later in the chapter. Before tackling that, look at other useful\nmeasures of volatility.\nTracking the maximum move\nOne way to measure volatility is to capture the largest price change over x number\nof days — the maximum move, also called gross move. You subtract the lowest low\nfrom the highest high over 10 days or 100 days or some other number of days.",

Notice\nthat at the beginning and middle of the chart, you could make as much as $30 in\na 30-day period in this security, but then the volatility of the price change tapers\noff to under $10 by the end of the chart. At that point, you’re taking less risk of a\ncatastrophic drop in the price over any 30-day period, but your profit potential\nhas just been cut to one-third of its previous glory, too — the usual trade-off\nbetween risk and reward.\nCHAPTER 14 Estimating Volatility 257",

Projecting volatility carries such\nhigh risk that it’s foolhardy.\nMaximum move and trend\nIn Figure 14-2, seeing the connection between the 30-day maximum move in the\ntop window and the prices in the bottom window is hard. The straight line starting\nat the middle of the bottom window is the linear regression (see Chapter 10). The\nline slopes upward means the price is in a slight uptrend, but at the same time,\nvolatility is on a downtrend. This is a good combination for you; trendedness is\ndelivering new profits at an ever-lower risk of a big one-period loss. But remem-\nber, low volatility precedes a breakout, so it may not be a good deal for long.\nThe price trend can differ in size and slope from the volatility trend. Sometimes\nthey’re in sync, rising or falling together, or they can move in opposite directions.\nKnowing something about the trend in the maximum move doesn’t necessarily\ntell you anything about the trend in prices, and vice versa.

He charted a simple 20-day moving average of the\nclosing price with a band on either side consisting of two standard deviations of\nthe moving average, effectively capturing about 95 percent of the variation away\nfrom the average.\nYou use Bollinger Bands to display the price in the context of a norm set at the\n20-day moving average, which is the number of days that Bollinger’s research\nshowed is the most effective in detecting variance in U.S. equities. The bands dis-\nplay relative highs and relative lows in the context of the moving average — they’re\nadaptive to the price by the amount of the standard deviation. The bands are, so to\nspeak, moving standard deviations.\nThe price touching or slightly breaking the top of the band is a continuation\nsignal. Often the price continues to walk up or walk down the band, as shown in\nFigure 14-5. A Bollinger Band breakout is just like any other breakout — you\nexpect the price to continue moving in the same direction as the breakout.\nCHAPTER 14 Estimating Volatility 261",

Bollinger Bands display the end\nof the upmove in two ways:\n» The price bar stops hugging the top band in an upmove, and slides down\nto the center moving average (or farther). In Figure 14-5, the retreat to the\nmoving average occurs at the ellipse. As a general rule, the failure to make a\nrelative new high signals the end of the move, although this time, the bulls\nmade a second effort to keep the rally going. In this case, the price was\nforming a double top (see Chapter 9).\n» The bands contract. When the bands contract, the range is narrowing.\nTraders are having second thoughts. They aren’t willing to test a new high, but\nthey aren’t willing to go short and generate new lows, either.\nThe narrowing of the trading range is named the squeeze and implies an impend-\ning breakout. Figure 14-5 displays a reversal, but a reversal isn’t the inevitable\noutcome. Breakouts can occur in the same direction as the original move, too. In\nthis case, the downside breakout of the bottom of the band occurred unusually\nquickly after an upside breakout of the top band.\nA rapid break of the opposite band is sometimes a head fake. In the case of a\ndownside move like the one in Figure 14-5, traders could have been overly exu-\nberant in taking profits after such a big run up to the high.

To detect head fakes, use Bollinger Bands with other confirm-\ning indicators, especially momentum indicators like the relative strength index\nand MACD (refer to Chapter 12).\nApplying Stops with Average\nTrue Range Bands\nBollinger Bands aren’t generally used to set stops. The bands are equidistant from\nthe moving average, so an upside breakout has the same statistical strength as a\ndownside breakout. When you have a strongly trending security, you can’t make a\nreversal move face a tougher breakout test — but logically, you should. I call it a\n“prove it” test. Given that false breakouts are so common, this reason makes it\nnecessary and sufficient for you to consider another type of band, as observed by\nsystem designer Steve Notis. (The Notis PBS software is no longer available, but if\nyou’re computationally competent, you can reproduce it in your charting\nsoftware.)\nTo use a band for a stop, you want the band to be asymmetrical, so that in an\nuptrend, a downmove has to be more severe than recent upmoves to trigger your\nstop. But you can’t filter Bollinger Bands. Instead of using the standard deviation\nto form the upper and lower bands, you can use a version of the average true range\n(ATR).",

You can adjust the ATR as follows so that a breakout proves that it’s statis-\ntically significant:\n» Uptrend: Widen the distance of the lower band from the average.\n» Downtrend: Widen the distance of the upper band from the average.\nThe greater width of one of the bands from the center moving average separates\ncorrective moves from real reversals. This move can become labor intensive, not\nleast because before you can widen either band you must be sure of the trend\ndirection. ATR doesn’t give you a read on directional volatility like standard\ndeviation.\nIn Figure 14-6, the price makes a bottom on the left-hand side and starts an\nupmove. The centerline is a moving average of the median price, or the average of\nthe high, low, and close.

When the price starts a new uptrend, the price breaking the upper band\nconfirms that you have identified the trend correctly.\nA downside breakout has to pass a bigger test in an uptrend. Accordingly, you widen\nthe lower band by adding a percentage of the ATR to it. On the chart in Figure 14-6,\nthe lower band is 50 percent wider than the upper band (it is 150 percent of the\nATR). The last bar on the chart breaks the band, just after the support line is bro-\nken. This is no mere retracement! You have a double breakout of the trend (sup-\nport) plus a volatility breakout (ATR band).\nAs with Bollinger Bands, a breakout above the upper band signals continuation,\nbut because breakouts are a sign of abnormally high volatility, you can usually\ncount on a pullback to the median. A longer-term position trader would buy at the\nleft-hand low and hold the break of the support line. A swing trader, on the other\nhand, would sell at breakout “1” and go short the security to the touch of the sup-\nport line at point “2.” Now he becomes a buyer again to point “3,” where high\nvolatility again triggers a short position that he holds to the break of the support\nline or final ATR band breakout.\nFew traders would use the ATR breakout alone as the sole deciding factor. On\nFigure 14-6, I put only a support line, but in practice, you would be looking at other\nindicators. I didn’t do the profit-and-loss arithmetic in this case, but it’s pretty\nclear that a swing trader using volatility would have made a series of gains that col-\nlectively added up to a higher profit than the trend-following buy-and-hold trader.\n264 PART 4 Dynamic Analysis",

It counts in cooking, romance, and a thousand activi-\nties. It counts so deeply in technical analysis–based trading that the word\n“timing” appears in the titles of many articles and books. So why throw\ntime out the window in constructing charts?\nThe answer is that important price moves can happen at any time. The time of day\n(or night) is irrelevant. What’s important is the price move. With some important\nexceptions, like the daily close or the month-end, price moves based on changing\nsentiment occur independently of time. They depend on the news and Events that\ndrive supply and demand.\nYou can divorce indicator signals that direct your buy/sell timing from conven-\ntional time constants. You don’t really care at what hour a breakout occurs; you\ncare far more about whether it’s a true breakout you should trade or a false one\nyou should ignore.

Tick\nbars don’t ignore time. The bottom horizontal x-axis on the chart looks the same\nas on any standard chart. But tick bars are in the spirit of the methods that do\nignore time, because they exist only when a minimum number of trades have\ntaken place. Not enough trades, no tick on the chart.\nYou get a tick entry on the chart only when a minimum number of trades has been\nachieved — however much time that takes. You get to define the number of trades\nin your software. The virtue of tick bars is that they display raw supply and demand\nwhen those characteristics are big enough to deserve notice.\nIf you set your custom tick size too big, whole days can go by with no entry on\nyour tick chart. You’ll still see regular bars and regular volume on a regular chart,\nbut there wasn’t enough true interest, as evidence by the number of trades, to\ngenerate an entry on the tick chart. In practice, a bunch of days with no tick\nentries means you set the threshold too high.\nWhen you set the tick threshold properly, a series of rising ticks with each tick\nrepresenting a large number of contracts or shares means the professionals are\nbuying. After all, only the professionals (hedge funds, fund managers, mutual\nfunds, and so on) have the capital to buy large number of shares, not the retail\namateurs (you and me).",

More than one\nanalyst claims to have invented constant range bars. The copyright on range bars\nbelongs to technical designer Danton Long, who introduced them in 2003 and also\ninvented several other original indicators (including a stop). Parallel invention\nor not, they’re available on only a few platforms, including TD Ameritrade,\nTradeStation, and CQG, plus some other broker platforms.\nThese sections take a closer look at constant range bars and how you can use them\nto make money trading securities.\nDefining a constant range bar\nLike point-and-figure charting, which I describe in the “Catching the Big Kahuna:\nPoint-and-Figure Charts” later in this chapter, the constant range bar takes only\nprice into consideration and simply ignores time.

When a price is moving sideways in\nthe same range, the result is a large expanse of empty spaces.\n» A distinct change from the previous one: In other words, a meaningful gap\nhas to occur outside the high-low range of the existing bar. It’s usually set at\none tick but can be set to a higher number of ticks, which makes sense when\nyou consider that you’re trying to identify change.

More than likely, floor traders in the\n1870s invented P&F as a pre-electronic way to record the relevant price moves\ninstead of every tiny fractional change. P&F charting strips away time and dis-\nplays only significant prices on the chart. Significant prices are those that exceed\nthe high or low of a recent trading range by a specified amount. You ignore minor\nmoves — literally. You don’t even record them on your chart. The result is filtered\nprice action. You don’t see a price move in the opposite direction of the current\ntrend until it meets your own definition of meaningful, raising confidence in the\naccuracy of a reversal signal.\nYou can also easily identify patterns on P&F charts, especially support and resis-\ntance, and therefore, breakouts of support and resistance. P&F charts look very\ndifferent from standard bar charts, but after you get used to them, you may find\ntheir directness and simplicity addictive. P&F is the easiest of all the technical\nconcepts, and as Jeremy du Plessis points out in The Definitive Guide to Point and\nFigure (Harriman House), the only computational method that is unique to finan-\ncial prices.

Engineers and scientists use measures like standard deviation, but\nthey never use P&F.

The purpose of the display method is to filter out irrelevant\nprices to isolate the trends.\nP&F analysis is suitable for trading that has a medium- to long-term holding\nperiod — weeks and months. The only way to know whether P&F charting is right\nfor you is to try it out on your chosen securities and see what gains you would’ve\nmade, how many trades it requires of you, and so on.\nVisualizing What’s Important\nTechnical indicators aim to identify trend-tuning points and, if a trend exists,\nhow strong it is.

If nothing noteworthy happened on a particular day, you put nothing on\nthe chart. Because chart events like a breakout or reversal often follow real-world\nevents (breaking news, for example), you can consider the P&F chart to be\nevent-driven.\nThe P&F method of displaying data takes time to get used to. Some people think\nthat it looks weird, while others take to it like a duck to water. Stick with it, though,\nand you can easily get the hang of it.\nPutting each move into a column\nIn P&F charting, you put a price entry on the chart only if the price is higher than\nthe previous high by a certain amount or lower than the previous low by a certain\namount.\nWhen a price is going sideways — not making a new high or low — nothing is\nhappening in the security, and you enter nothing on the chart.\nFor a new high that is higher than the previous high, you enter an X. For a new low\nthat is lower than the previous low, you enter an O. You place the Xs and Os in a\ncolumn that represents a continuous move, either up or down. The P&F chart con-\ntains alternating columns of Xs and Os, where each column is a move. A column\nof Xs is an upmove and a column of Os is a downmove.

If today’s new high is $12, you\nacknowledge that this is a price extreme — four times the usual daily trading\nrange — and deserves a new X in the X column. In fact, in this case, the new high\nis a full $2 over the last high, so you fill in two $1 boxes with the X notation. What\nhappens if the price changes by $.98? Nothing. The new price is close to the box\nsize of $1, but close doesn’t count.\nChoosing a box size\nWhen you select a small box size, you’re asking to see a lot of detail, including\nsmall retracements. By increasing the box size, you’re filtering out filler data, just\nlike when you make a rule that requires a price to cross a moving average by\nx percent (see Chapters 12 and 13 for a discussion of filtering).\nThe smaller the box, the more sensitive the chart is to price changes.

The software uses the box size that fits the highest range\nin the data series in order to get everything on one chart. But the trading range of\nany single security changes over time, and you want to take note of that rather\nthan let the software obscure the changing range. If you use P&F charting soft-\nware, fix the box size so you know whether the range is expanding or\ncontracting.\nAdding the reversal amount to the picture\nThe purpose of the box size is to note a significant change in price. But how do you\nknow how far a price has to move below the X (upward) column to warrant start-\ning an O (downward) column? For that, you establish a second criterion, the rever-\nsal amount. The traditional reversal amount is three boxes. If your box is $1 and\nyou’re now in a rising X column, you have to get a new low that is $3 lower than\nthe low today to start a new O (downward) column.\nYou can backtest a variety of box sizes and reversal amounts to arrive at the best\nnumbers to use for any particular security. As a general rule, though, P&F char-\ntists recommend sticking to the three-box rule for reversals and adopting differ-\nent box sizes for chart entries, depending on the absolute level of the prices.\nA box size of $4, the appropriate box for a security selling over $200, with a three-\nbox reversal, works out to $12. If you have 100 shares, you would exit on a reversal\nof at least $1,200, which is a fairly hefty sum of money.",

But to understand the process,\nimagine for a minute you’re doing it by hand. To draw the chart, every day you\ncheck the highest high and lowest low of the day.

Because it’s a reversal, now you\nexpect the next entry to be one box lower. The next day, is the low price lower than\nyesterday by $1? If so, enter another O.

As with conventional support and resis-\ntance lines, don’t erase a support line after it’s broken — it has a good chance of\nbecoming the new resistance line. An old resistance line may become the new\nsupport line, too.\nBecause a P&F chart filters out noisy prices and compresses time, your chart often\ndisplays authentic long-term support or resistance that you’d miss on a regular\ndaily bar chart. You may also see triangles, which are support and resistance lines\nthat converge. Chapter 9 covers triangles.\nThe top-right chart in Figure 15-2 shows a conventional support line. You could\nhave a conventional (sloping) resistance line, too. Notice that if your boxes are\nperfectly square, you can draw a 45-degree line and extend it out into the future\nby starting with just two columns when one of the columns is one box higher or\nlower than the other. The 45-degree technique allows you to start a support or\nresistance line more simply and sometimes earlier than in conventional bar chart-\ning. The upward-sloping 45-degree line is named a bullish support line, and a\ndownward-sloping 45-degree line is a bearish resistance line.\nCHAPTER 15 Ignoring Time to Create Better Timing 275",

When bulls fail to get a breakout above the established high, it’s a\npretty good sign that sellers are happy to unload the security at that price. When\nyou get more than one low at about the same level, it’s a double or triple bottom,\nwhere buyers think it’s a bargain, and the price is likely to rise. See Chapter 9 for\na discussion of double and triple tops and bottoms.\nA double or triple top or bottom can be either a reversal pattern or a continuation\npattern in P&F charting, depending on the behavior of the opposite-direction col-\numns. In conventional time-based bar charting, you have to wait for confirmation\nof these patterns — chewing up time. P&F, therefore, can speed up the process of\nhelping you decide whether you’re getting a reversal or a continuation.\nIn regular bar charting, a confirmed double top has a high probability of resulting\nin a price drop. A qualified double bottom leads to a price rise. They’re reversal\npatterns, which you can see in chart form in Figure 15-2. In P&F, however, char-\ntists find that in an uptrend of Xs, if the intervening Os are on a rising line (the\nlowest low in the last O column isn’t as low as the lowest low in the previous\nO column), a double top may turn into a triple top and then an upside breakout —\nin other words, a continuation pattern.

If the opposite-direction columns are horizontal, though,\nthe traditional reversal interpretation is probably correct.\nProjecting Prices after a Breakout\nP&F chartists forecast prices after a breakout by using the box count, either verti-\ncally or horizontally.

The following sections discuss how to make your own forecasts\nbased on P&F chart breakouts.\nIn P&F charting, you buy when the new price surpasses the highest X in the previ-\nous X column, and you sell when the new price surpasses the lowest low O in the\nprevious O column.

Because other indicators are time based, how\ncan this merger be done?\nHere’s how you can use P&F charting along with other indicators:\n» Moving averages: You use the price at the center of each column in calculat-\ning a moving average in P&F charts instead of the usual method of averaging\nprices over a fixed number of periods. Thus you’re using the average price per\nreversal. If the moving average shows that you had a downtrend and now you\nget a new column of Xs that rises over the moving average, you have more\nconfidence that the Xs really do imply a rising trend and thus a safer\nbuy signal.\n» Parabolic stop-and-reverse indicator: The parabolic stop-and-reverse (SAR)\nindicator delivers a speedier reversal than waiting for a new column of Xs or\nOs. The parabolic SAR has the advantage of tightening your stop as the\nmomentum of a price move decelerates.\n» Bollinger Bands: Data displayed in the P&F format can’t display momentum\nand thus overbought or oversold, a shortcoming that can be partly addressed\nby applying Bollinger Bands (refer to Chapter 14). If your columns of Xs persist\nin pressing against the top of the band and sometimes breaking it, you have\nconfirmation of the uptrend.",

The confirmation principle is well-established as a core\nconcept in technical analysis and a perfectly logical safeguard against the unhappy\nfact that any single indicator will be wrong some of the time.

Or should you choose three, or four,\nor more? Because technical analysis has produced thousands of stand-alone indi-\ncators and patterns, the number of possible combinations and permutations is\nhumungous. By the time you add time constraints, such as “Buy 30 minutes after\nthe open (or high or low or close) if x, y, and z occur,” the number of potential\ntrading rules can be in the millions.\nAdding a new indicator piles on complexity and can get tricky. When you combine\nindicators, they often contradict one another. One indicator says buy, whereas a\ndifferent indicator says sell. This conflict is common. Worse, one indicator will\nalways issue a buy or sell signal before the second one. A large portion of the gain\nto be had from a new move comes in the first few periods, so if you wait for con-\nfirmation from an additional indicator, you’re giving up potential profits in return\nfor the comfort of expecting fewer false breakouts.\nThe price of your security, for example, crossed above its moving average and you\nbought it.

In this case, you’re using the Donchian\n5/20-day moving average crossover (buy when the 5-day crosses above the\n20-day and sell when it falls below the 20-day). You get a sell signal. A little later,\nthe price bounces and you get a buy signal followed in a few weeks by another sell\nsignal — a whipsaw. But before then, you can’t avoid noticing the double top,\neven though pattern recognition isn’t one of the indicators in your toolkit. But it’s\nthe gorilla in the room on this chart, so you run right out and research it. The rule\nin double-top analysis is that after the confirmation point is reached, the price\noften pulls back above it before resuming the downtrend, giving you a better\nopportunity to go short.

In Figure 16-2,\nthe main window shows the primary trading concept, a moving average crossover.\nYou buy when the 5-day moving average closes above the 20-day moving average\n(the thicker line) and sell when the price closes below the thinner 5-day moving\naverage.",

You still have to sit down with a piece of paper or a spread-\nsheet and perform the expectancy calculation, even if you used indicators not in\nyour usual toolkit on some trades or applied nontechnical judgments. Nontechni-\ncal judgments are called discretionary. Among professionals, discretionary manag-\ners outnumber system managers by a large amount. Discretionary managers\ncherry-pick trades, add or subtract technical indicators, consider nontechnical\nfactors, and are vulnerable to emotion — the very thing you’re trying to avoid. By\ndefinition, you can’t backtest discretionary trading systems. But you can deter-\nmine expectancy with any trading history, even if it’s not exact.\nDiscretionary trading can be successful and the limited expectancy you get from a\ndiscretionary trading history may be valid because humans learn. Popular author\nMalcolm Gladwell (The Tipping Point, Outliers, and other best-sellers, Hachette\nBook Group) writes that expertise arises from a minimum of 10,000 hours of\npractice at a specific task.

By sheer force of having observed the\nprices of a single security all day, every day for many years, the trader gets a feel\nfor the price action. After spotting something, the trader draws the indicator on\nthe chart to validate what he saw. Sometimes he makes a decision based on a\ncandle pattern, and other times he decides based on a classic pattern like\nhead-and-shoulders, a breakout accompanied by a volume spike, or any of a\ndozen other combinations. But note the intuitive trader hardly ever makes a trad-\ning decision on a single indicator. Theoretically he could go back and define exactly\nwhat were the bases of the judgment calls — the trading decisions — but it’s not\na system per se. Estimating positive expectancy from a few ad-hoc indicators\ntakes year of practice, and I don’t recommend it for the newcomer.\nSo should you build a trading system? If you want reliable and consistent results\nover a long period of time, yes.

You have to work quite hard to embed squaring rules\nwhere you have no position. Your software wants you to have a position! The very\nnature of a buy/sell system is that it contains a bias to be in the market all the\ntime. To be square is to be indecisive, and the very nature of a buy/sell system is\nto deliver a trading decision.\nCombining indicators to create a buy/sell system is fairly easy, but it’s devilishly\nhard to fold in squaring rules. Some systems are buy/sell only with no squaring\nrules for exactly this reason — it’s so hard to build them. In the absence of squar-\ning rules, though, you’re at risk of overtrading — swinging at every ball that\ncomes over the plate but hitting only a small percentage and counting on the\noccasional home run to generate your good win/loss stats.\nThe squaring problem has another pernicious aspect — reentering in the same\ndirection after your stop has been hit, which is called the continuation rule prob-\nlem. Should the rules for reentering in the same direction trade be the same or\ndifferent from a first-time entry? Traders and statisticians alike quarrel about it.\nAllowing yourself discretion in this circumstance is a key reason system traders\nslip into discretionary trading in the first place.",

You identify a specific bar configuration, trade it, and get out.\nOne of the latest additions to this genre is trading penny stock-pot stocks on a\nsingle candlestick. Because most pot stocks don’t have earnings or other funda-\nmentals, traders are flying on rumor and blind faith. Often rumors suffice. The\npot-stock strategy is to wait for a giant white candlestick that was triggered by an\nannouncement or a rumor, buy as soon as possible, and exit with a gain in short\norder, sometimes the same day, before the penny stock falls back. Promoters\nadvertise that a 12-cent pot stock rose to 30 cents before falling back to 12 cents,\nwhich is a 150 percent gain. Dozens of penny pot stocks do the same thing.

Instead of having a buy/sell system,\nyou have a strategy of trading only the setup. The big white pot-stock candlestick\nis a setup.\nA setup is a particular configuration of bars, usually with one or two other con-\nfirming conditions like a pattern or an indicator, that delivers an expected out-\ncome in a high proportion of trades. Candlestick trading can be considered setup\ntrading, too (see Chapter 8).\nA simple but effective one-rule concept is to buy when the price moves above the\nrange established in the first x number of minutes of trading. Say the first half\nhour of trading from the open generates a range of $5 to 5.50. As soon as the price\nhits $5.75, you get in. Where do you get out? That depends on how much you want\nto take home. It could be a few minutes or a few hours, but your intent is to exit\nthe same day.

Crabel calls this strategy the opening range\nbreakout. With the opening range breakout, you can improve the odds of getting a\nsuccessful trade by adding one or more confirmation validators, such as:\n» The preceding bar was an inside day or doji (refer to Chapter 8).\n» The x-minute opening range over the past three to ten days was narrowing\n(see Chapter 14).\n» The opening is a gap from the day before (see Chapter 7).\nFiguring out why setups work\nSetups generally win by entering very early in a move, unlike systems based on\nindicators that await confirmation from always-lagging indicators.

You take no risk when you’re out of the market. Many setup trades\nare intraday, where you enter and exit the trade on the same day. Other setup\ntrades are more long-lasting because they lead to authentic trends that you stick\nto until your exit rules or stop is hit.

When you correctly identify the setup, the\nprice goes in your direction immediately. And when a strong move begins, the\nfirst few minutes, hours, or days can account for 25 percent or more of the total\nmove. That’s the thrust or impulse aspect of new moves.\nThe key to setup trading is early identification of a trading opportunity and thus\nearly entry. As a general rule, your goal as a setup trader is to take a profit bite out\nof a move without necessarily having a position over the entire move, like a sys-\ntem trader.\nUsing ruthless exits\nEfficient entries and ruthless exits are the hallmark of setup swing trading, but\nbeing quick on the trigger doesn’t imply that the trader is a wild-eyed risk taker.\nQuite the opposite.",

The top one is that setup trading requires intense concentration. In system\ntrading, you can place your orders and walk away — your stop and profit-target\norders will keep you safe. But setup trades must be watched. Remember the\nfollowing:\n» A setup that you like may not appear every day or even every month. With a\nsmall universe of securities, you’d have to memorize a dozen setups if you\nwant to be in the market much of the time. If you like only one or two setups,\nyou have to monitor a large universe of securities.\n» If you focus on setups to the exclusion of all the other technical concepts,\nyou’re at a loss for what to do when setups don’t appear.\n» To find your favorite setups, you have to scan a list of securities, and the best\nsetups may appear in securities that you wouldn’t touch with a bargepole on a\nfundamental or value basis.\n» Setups require intense concentration and often the ability to trade actively\nduring market hours.

A cycle is made up\nof waves, and the wave is modeled on the sine wave as Figure 17-1 shows.

Whether the impulse for financial\nmarket prices to form cycles is inherent in the universe or arises from some\nunexplained aspect of crowd behavior, nobody knows.\nThink of the following to differentiate between cycles and waves:\n» Cycles have a repetitive character. Not only will prices surge and retreat, but\nthey’ll also surge and retreat in a more or less orderly manner so that you can\ncount the periods between them and use that count to project the next surge\nand retreat.\n» Waves, on the other hand, can be big or small, short-term or long-lasting,\nchoppy or orderly.

Refer to Chapter 2 to read about George Soros’s reflexivity feedback loop.\nThis idea postulates that expectation of a market price move causes crowd behav-\nior that validates the very price behavior that was expected. If and when the crowd\nis disappointed because an intervening Event has now changed conditions, a new\nexpectation gets a grip and the crowd causes that expectation to come true, too.\nThis causes an up-and-down pattern that can have the appearance of regularity —\notherwise known as cyclicality.\nStarting with economics\nThe economic cycle is the process by which an economy (and the businesses in it)\nexpand, reach a peak, and then contract and go into recession.

But\nhow do you use the wavelengths? Hurst assumes that even though cycles are pro-\nfoundly influential, they don’t dictate the exact price moves. More than one will be\noperational at any one time. The way to identify an uptrending cycle is to add the\nslope of the five longer-duration cycles above the one on which you’re working.\nSo if you’re considering a 20-day cycle, you add up the slopes of the 40-day, the\n80-day, the 20-week, the 40-week, and the 18-month cycles. You’re looking for\na confluence of all the cycles to identify a turning point, although you may have to\nshift some cycles to make them fit the larger cycle. This seems to be similar to the\nsecret Rothschild system of waiting for cycles in various commodities and eco-\nnomic indicators to line up to deliver buy/sell signals.\nAlthough Hurst’s book, The Profit Magic of Stock Transaction Timing, is out of print,\nyou can find it secondhand.

Falling market prices occur a few days after a new moon. Using\nthe Chinese lunar calendar, major market crashes tend to occur about three days\nbefore a new moon and often in the eighth and ninth Chinese lunar calendar\n(September or October in the West). As it happens, the U.S. crashes in 1929, 1987,\nand 2008 did occur in September or October, and the more slow-moving crash in\n2000 occurred in October to December. However, this theory doesn’t account for\ncrashes in other countries or other asset classes.

Adjusting for weekend and\nholidays, you expect to see a major security index cycle every 20 days or so. And\nacademic research using fancy statistical techniques prove those 20-day cycles do\nexist with some regularity in many countries.\nSaros cycle\nAnother lunar cycle idea pertains to the Saros cycle, or the way the moon revolves\naround the earth in an elliptical pattern, causing supermoons (when the moon is\nclosest to the earth and appears to the naked eye as far bigger than usual) and\neclipses. Eclipses are associated with some notable financial events, including the\nTulip Mania crash in 1637, the 1979 dollar crisis, and the 1997 emerging markets\ncrash. And yet eclipses of one sort or another occur about four to seven times per\nyears in one place or another without affecting financial markets, and no specific\nfinancial cycle theory is associated with the Saros cycle.\nThe Saros cycle is 18 years, 11 days, and 8 hours. That’s interesting because more\nthan one nonlunar cycle analyst has come up with a U.S. stock market cycle that’s\nroughly the same amount of time, including one that is 17.6 years, the Balenthiran\ncycle.

Notice that Hurst data-\nmining that I discuss earlier has a cycle lasting 17.93 years.\nAdding more celestial bodies\nOne lunar cycle system that has befuddled generations of technical analysts is The\nDelta phenomenon promoted by Welles Wilder in his book The Delta Phenomenon\nor The Hidden Order in All Markets (The Delta Society). Wilder was one of the top\npioneers in technical analysis and much respected. He invented the relative\nstrength index (RSI), the average true range (ATR), average directional index\n(ADI), and the parabolic stop-and-reverse indicator. The original offering of the\nsecret formula in the 1980s was for $35,000 to join the Delta Society, which still\nexists today. Now you can get the original book for less than $50.\nThe Delta phenomenon identifies turning points using the confluence of a 4-day,\na 4-month, a 1-year, a 4-year, and a 19-year cycle. The supposed hidden symme-\ntry of the market is disclosed when you see the confluence of the short-term delta\n(every four revolutions of the earth) and the intermediate delta (every four revo-\nlutions of the moon around the earth) and the medium-term delta (the complete\ntidal cycle) and the long-term delta (every four revolutions of the earth around\nthe sun).

They’re called sun-\nspots and are caused by a change in temperature that is caused in turn by a change\nin magnetic force. Sunspots last anywhere from a few days to a few months. How\nmany sunspots are visible changes according to a roughly 11-year solar cycle. If\nyou conduct an Internet search for the term sunspots, you can find a chart show-\ning the regularity of sunspots over the past 400 years.\nLinking sunspots with economic and stock market activity goes back as far as\n1730, when a rise in sunspots is seen as increasing human excitability and causing\nrallies. In the 1930s and again in 1965, analysts found a strong correlation between\na rise in sunspot activity and U.S. stock market performance, specifically that\nstock market rally peaks consistently precede sunspot cycle maximums. From\n1750 to 2000, the sunspot cycle was 11.7 years. In the 20th century, the average\nsunspot cycle was 10.3 years.\nFiguring out what’s (maybe) wrong\nwith astronomy cycle theories\nAnything that helps you understand market sentiment can be useful, no matter\nhow outlandish.

Seasonality is the term used for the natural rise and fall of\nprices according to the time of year.\nOddly — very oddly — equities and financial futures exhibit a similar effect: They\nchange according to the time of year. The changes are regular and consistent\nenough to warrant your attention.\nDifferentiating between seasonality\nand calendar effects\nSeasonality used to be a term applied to agricultural prices, and calendar effects was\na term applied to equities. Today they’re used interchangeably. You can discover\nthe seasonality characteristics of any given stock by using seasonality trackers on\nvarious websites, including the following:\n» Thomson Financial Seasonality Tracker: This site (https://charts.\nequityclock.com/thomson-reuters-corporation-tsetri-seasonal-\nchart) is the best known. Plug in your own stock ticker symbols to get a chart\nshowing ups and down attributable to seasonality.\n» Time and Timing: Another excellent site is www.timeandtiming.com, which\ncovers all the top futures contracts (interest rates, currencies, metals, oil and\ngas, and agricultural commodities). In addition to vast amounts of historical\ncomparisons, you can find trading ideas that worked in the past, complete\nwith average gain, win-loss ratio, and so on.\nThe most well-known calendar effects\nIn equities, you have probably heard the adage, “Sell in May and go away.” This\nadvice comes from work on calendar effects by Yale Hirsch and his son Jeffrey\nHirsch, who tested the correlation of stock indices with the time of year in their\nannual Stock Trader’s Almanac (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).

This rule isn’t true without exception, but it’s true for\nmost years since 1950. When April 30 rolls around, you sell all your stocks and put\nthe money in U.S. Treasury bills. Come November 1, you reenter the stock market.\nIf you had followed this rule every year since 1950 and also modified the exact\ntiming a little by applying the moving average convergence-divergence indicator\n(check out MACD in Chapter 12), a starting capital stake of $10,000 in 1950 would\nhave ballooned to $2,846,350 by April 2018. On average, you would’ve been\ninvested only six and a half months each year — and remember, when you’re not\nin the market, you’re not taking market risk.\nOther calendar effects include\n» January Barometer: When the S&P 500 is up in January, it’ll close the year\nhigher than it opened.

Gann (1878–1955). In addition to writing\nnumerous books about technical analysis, he also wrote many other books (see the\nnearby sidebar).\nGann covered the waterfront of themes in this chapter. He discovered a set of\ncommodity cycles of 20, 30, 45, 60, 84, and 90 years. He used astronomy. He dis-\ncovered magic numbers. He applied geometry to charts to derive shorter-term\ncycles. I cover only a few of Gann’s ideas in the following sections.\nFor example, Gann discovered repetitive price behavior using spirals, angles, and\na hexagonal chart that traders use today. The spiral chart uses as anchoring points\nthe two equinoxes and the two solstices, whereas the hexagonal chart uses plan-\netary positions. Your charting software won’t include these methodologies. If you\nlike them, you’ll have to buy Gann software or look online for it.\nApplying core Gann concepts\nWhat most standard software does include is the Gann angle and Gann fan.

You expect\nthe price to move the same one unit over the same length of time going forward.\nOther versions include 2x1 (price changes by two units per one unit of time) and\nother multiples up to 16x1.\nWhen you’re using the slope of a support line or standard error channel — in\nother words, the degree of steepness — to gauge the robustness of the trend by eye,\nremember the 1x1 Gann angle. You’ll find that a flattish slope (like 25 degrees)\nmeans the trend is weak, and a too-steep slope (like 70 degrees) means it’s flaky\nand prone to correction, but the 45 degree angle is just right to predict continua-\ntion of your trend with some confidence.

Gann is best known for books\nlike How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities and Forty-Five Years in Wall Street. He may\nhave used a pseudonym to write The Ancient Science of Numbers, purportedly by one Luo\nClement, as well as Astrology and Stock Market Forecasting by Louise McWhirter.\nGann used the 45 degree angle as the starting point of an additional eight lines\nspaced at specific intervals off the starting point, forming a Gann fan. The starting\npoint is a top or bottom on the chart extended out by hand to the next low or high,\nand the fan lines represent alternative support and resistance lines. It’s likely that\nlater techniques using geometrics similar to the Gann fan (Andrews pitchfork and\nspeed resistance lines, not covered in this book) were based on this 1935 work\nby Gann.\nCelebrating Gann’s 50 percent\nretracement rule\nOne of Gann’s more lasting contributions to technical analysis is the 50 percent\nretracement rule. Gann discovered that retracements in the securities he was\ntrading at the time tended to occur at one-half of the original move from the low\nto the high. To illustrate, say the price moved from $10 to $30. At $30, the crowd\ndecided that the security was overbought and started to sell. The ensuing price\ndecline, the retracement, stops near 50 percent of the original $10 to $30 move,\nnamely $20.

The area around 50 percent is a danger zone, because the price can keep\ngoing and become a full-fledged reversal around there (in which case you lose all\nthe gains). But it’s the best place to reenter an existing trend (with an exit planned\njust below using a stop-loss order in case it doesn’t work). If the trend resumes,\nGann wrote that it will then exceed the previous high, which gives you an auto-\nmatic minimum profit target. This observation may be the origin of the phrase,\n“Buy on the dip.”\nGann also saw retracements occurring at the halfway point of a move, such as\n25 percent (half of 50 percent), 12.5 percent (half of 25 percent), and so on. Stat-\nisticians can’t offer proof that retracements occur at 12.5 percent, 25 percent, or\n50 percent with more frequency than chance would allow. The absence of statis-\ntical proof in a field populated by mathematical sophisticates is puzzling at first.\nBut when you ask a statistician why not just run the numbers and test the hypoth-\nesis, the statistician will point out that defining the low-to-high original move\nand then defining the stopping point of a retracement is a computational night-\nmare. No matter what definitions you give the software, another analyst is sure to\nwant to refine them in some other way.

And it’s possible that because so many\ntechnical analysts know about the Gann 50 percent rule, it tends to become\nself-fulfilling.\nA critical point about the 50 percent retracement rule is that you may think you\nwant to exit to protect your profit at the 50 percent level. If you bought the secu-\nrity at $10 and it rose to $30, but has now fallen to $20, shown in Figure 17-1, you\nwant to sell at $20 to hang on to the gain you have left. But if the 50 percent\nretracement rule works this time, you’d be getting out exactly when you should be\nbuying more (adding to your position), because a resumption of the trend at the\n$20 level almost certainly means that the price will now go higher than the high-\nest high so far, $30.\nAnother puzzle: A 100 percent retracement, a price that goes from $10 to $30 and\nback to $10, will often form a double bottom, a bullish formation. When the price\npeaks twice at the same level, you have a double top, a bearish formation. (See\nChapter 9 for more details on these formations.)\nCHAPTER 17 Judging Cycles and Waves 311",

A trader named Ralph Nelson Elliott believed that man’s behavior, includ-\ning his behavior when trading in the stock market, revealed similar characteristics\nas the Fibonacci sequence and could, therefore, be charted to predict future behav-\nior. Elliott observed that securities prices appear in a wavelike form on charts,\nhence the name of his forecasting method, Elliott Wave, which I discuss in these\nsections.\nCONNECTING THE ELLIOTT WAVE\nTO FIBONACCI\nThe foundation of Elliott Wave theory is the Fibonacci sequence of numbers. A 13th-\ncentury Italian mathematician named Fibonacci discovered a self-replicating sequence\nof numbers with curious properties. It starts with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,\nand so on to infinity. After the first few numbers, the sum of two adjacent numbers in\nthe sequence forms the next higher number in the sequence. Most important, the ratio\nof any two consecutive numbers approximates 1.618 or its inverse, 0.618. One to 1.618\nis named the “golden ratio.”\nNature offers many examples of this ratio: daisy petals, ferns, sunflowers, seashells,\nhurricanes, whirlpools, and atomic particles in a bubble chamber. And many of man’s\nworks purportedly embody the Fibonacci ratios as well: the pyramids in Egypt, the\nParthenon in Greece, and Cézanne’s choice of canvas shape, although some mathema-\nticians dispute some or all of these.",

In fact, many of the named instances of the golden\nratio in nature, anatomy, art, and architecture don’t pass the test. A good example is the\nshell of the chambered nautilus, which supposedly obeys the golden ratio, but look it\nup — nautilus shells’ average growth ratios of 1.24 to 1.43 are quite far from 1.618.\nOf course, critics point out that many other events in nature, architecture, and human\nbehavior follow a sequence of 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. The number 11 can be considered\nmagic, not to mention pi (3.14159), used to calculate the circumference of a circle. Prime\nnumbers, which are numbers divisible only by themselves and one (3, 5, 7, 11, 17, and\nso on), are important numbers. In fact, many other self-replicating number sequences\nexist. In short, scientists say that to attribute human behavior to any single number\nsequence is ludicrous, or at least not plausible.\nHistorically, the golden ratio initially arose from Euclid, who was fascinated by the\npentagon, which has five sides — and yet five is not a magic number.\n312 PART 4 Dynamic Analysis",

Each\nimpulse wave has five parts: three waves that go in the trend direction,\nalternating with two that go in the opposite direction.\n» In a correction, each corrective wave has three parts: two that go against the\nmain trend and one that goes with it. If a bull market reaches a new high in\nfive waves instead of three and also goes down in five waves instead of three,\nyou’re witnessing the beginning of a major bear market.\nYou’ll often see three clear waves up, although sometimes a move has more\nupwaves than three, as in Figure 17-4. The three-waves rule is only the model of\nhow markets move, not a rigid orthodoxy.\nFIGURE 17-4:\nWavelike\nappearance\nof a trend.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nElliot Wave practitioners are the first to admit that calling corrective waves is\ntricky, much harder than seeing impulse waves.

A correction\noften also just keeps on going, whereupon it isn’t a correction but a true reversal\nand thus a new trend in the opposite direction.\nCounting waves can be an elaborate and time-consuming process, and miscount-\ning as prices evolve can result in losses and having to start all over again. If the\nwave idea appeals to you, be prepared to devote a lot of time to it. If you choose\nnot to count waves, you can still benefit from the observation that trends start\nwith an impulse wave that then retraces in the opposite direction before the trend\nresumes. “Buy on the dip” isn’t bad advice when you’re sure that you have a\ntrend.\nFigure 17-4 shows a security with four waves and three corrections (69.2 percent,\n35.7 percent, and 78 percent). Notice that none of the percentage retracements\nqualifies precisely as a Gann or Fibonacci number, although you might stretch the\npoint and say that 68 percent isn’t all that far from 62 percent (Fibonacci) and 78\npercent is fairly close to 75 percent (Gann). Most traders acknowledge the wave-\nlike movement of prices even if they don’t try to count them according to the Elli-\nott Wave principle.\nThe wave idea became popular in part because its leading proponent, Robert Pre-\nchter, called for a massive bull market in 1982 that did materialize — and then he\ncalled the top, just ahead of the 1987 Crash.

Both Gann and Elliott supply answers.\nAs I note earlier in the “Shining a Spotlight on the Magnificent Mr. Gann” section,\nGann believed the 50 percent retracement offered a nearly surefire method of\nentering a new trade after a 50 percent retracement. Fans of the Fibonacci sequence\nassert that the 38 percent and 62 percent retracement levels occur more often\nthan chance would allow and are reliable retracement ending points to reenter a\ntrade.

Nicole Elliott in the excellent book Ichimoku Charts,\nAn Introduction to Ichimoku Kinko Clouds (Harriman House) offers the historical context\nas well as some linguistic explanations. Ichimoku means “glance” or “at a glance,” while\nKinko means “balance” in a literal translation from the Chinese characters used in Japan.\nThe final word in the label is “hyo,” which in Chinese translates to “bar chart.”\nYou’ll see other translations. Stockcharts.com has the translation, “one look equilib-\nrium chart.” Don’t let any of the labels get in your way. Most people say just “ichimoku”\nor “cloud.” What you want to stick in your mind are two things:\n• The concept of balance or equilibrium\n• “At a glance”\nSome analysts believe the word equilibrium implies a sense of seeking “value” and not\njust “price.” Karen Peloille in Trading with Ichimoku (Harriman House) is more inclined to\nsee equilibrium as a stalemate of opposing forces — and a fleeting one at that.\nTaking a Closer Look at Ichimoku\nIchimoku’s design is intended to deliver an instant visual snapshot of a price’s\ntrendedness — up or down, strong or weak, nearing or at a turning point, and\nother aspects of the price move.

This is a sister-under-the-\nskin of the theory of reversion to the mean that I discuss in Chapter 2.\nIn a nutshell, ichimoku places a series of specific fixed-number moving averages\non the chart, and the crossover delivers the buy/sell signal, as in conventional\ntechnical analysis. Ichimoku also projects an arithmetic manipulation of the\nmoving averages into the future to create an area of support/resistance (named a\ncloud) that is self-adjusting because it’s based on the moving averages.

For example, in conventional\nanalysis, analysts consider the relationship of the close to the high. If the close is\nat the high, the market is wildly bullish. If the close is at the low, sentiment is\nseriously bearish, and both of those judgments inform your decision on your next\ntrade. But the ichimoku mindset considers the high and low as extremes when\nwhat you’re seeking is the best expression of sentiment — the average.\nIn addition, conventional technical analysis uses the close to calculate moving\naverages (as well as other indicators). Not so in ichimoku, which uses a slew of\nmoving averages calculated on the average of the high and low over the period, not\nthe close alone. This makes a great deal of sense if you consider that what you’re\naiming for in a moving average is the essence of the price change. So, a conven-\ntional moving average built on the close will incorporate some of those wildly\nbullish or bearish price extremes, while the ichimoku technique waters them\ndown by using the midpoint. Think of ichimoku as using moving midpoints rather\nthan moving averages based on the close.\nA third difference is that ichimoku calculates averages based on past data but then\nprojects some of those lines out into the future. This is such a problem for soft-\nware designers that it took several years for them to catch up.",

And oddly —\nvery oddly — when Gerald Appel devised the MACD in the late 1970s, he also used\n26 days as one of the parameters, long before ichimoku became known in the\nWest. He selected 26 days because it was the optimum number over a gazillion\ntrials. (Check out Chapter 2 for more on the law of large numbers.)

But projection serves the purpose of illustrating\nwhere balance lies. In the chart in Figure 18-3, the scale is tipping to one side —\ndownward.

After a giant rally on the left-hand side, the security slides downward\nfor a prolonged period. The cloud is effective resistance on four occasions. When\nthe price finally does break above the cloud on the right-hand side, the cloud is\nthin and sure enough, the latest price is testing support at the very bottom of the\ncloud.\nRefer back to Figure 18-1 and the plain vanilla moving average crossover; you’d\nhave had 12 trades. In following just the moving average crossover plus buying or\nselling only when price is above or below the cloud, the number of trades is pared\ndown to four. In practice, you may use additional non-ichimoku measures for\nentry and exit, but ichimoku alone reduced the total number of trades and rescued\nyou from moving average whipsaws.\nStay with me — there’s more. Finally, add the chikou line, which is today’s close\nplotted 26 days into the past. This is hard to understand, but ichimoku traders\nswear it’s the most important thing on the chart. As long as the chikou is above\nthe price bars, you’re confident market sentiment is still bullish, and the more\nspace, the better. When it starts poking down into the bars, sentiment is turning\nnegative. Think about downward poking for a minute — it means today’s price is\nlower than prices over the past 26 days. The drop hasn’t reached the moving aver-\nages yet and thus not the cloud, either, but you can see “at a glance” that senti-\nment is shifting. This is the sense in which chikou displays momentum. It’s not\nmeasured in exact numbers like relative strength or MACD — although you could\ntake the exact number from your software data window and do something extra\nwith it. One only slightly goofy thing to do with chikou is to hand-draw the line at\nthe same slope out into the next period.\nIchimoku gives clear signals when prices are clearly trending and a tangle of lines\nwhen prices aren’t trending.

What\nif the chikou line is far above or below both the prices and the cloud? In Figure 18-3,\nthe chikou line is deeply below both prices and the cloud. You may say this is a\nmeasure of being oversold and suspect an upside correction could be on the way.\nSure enough, the chikou bottoms just past the middle of the chart and prices do\nindeed surge above the cloud after that. You should buy when the chikou crosses\nabove the close and sell when it crosses below. The chikou plots a possible future\nthat quite often turns out to be correct.\nUsing Ichimoku in Your Analysis\nYou can use ichimoku a little or a lot. You are welcome to experiment with ichi-\nmoku in setting up your trading rules. Here is some guidance on a few issues.\nVenturing inside the cloud\nThe buy signal in ichimoku is the crossover of the two moving averages with the\nadditional condition that current prices must be above the cloud. When both con-\nditions are met, it’s fairly safe to buy. The opposite is true for a downside moving\naverage crossover and prices needing to be below the cloud.\nWhat if you have the crossover but prices venture inside the cloud? Some analysts\nsay get out until that above/below the cloud condition is met. This squaring rule\nensures you’re trading only when the trend is very strong. It may also leave you\ntwiddling your thumbs for longer than you like. Other analysts say it’s okay to\nhold a long position with the current price inside the cloud as long as the bottom\nedge of the cloud isn’t broken.",

Other analysts say it’s okay to\nhold a long position with the current price inside the cloud as long as the bottom\nedge of the cloud isn’t broken. In other words, you can use the cloud as a built-in\nstop loss. If you’re long and the price falls to the cloud top, you can have a stop at\nthe cloud top for (say) half your positions. The other half has a stop placed just\nbelow the bottom of the cloud. This two-part exit rule has the virtue of being\ncrystal clear and simple, but it’s labor-intensive — you have to change the two\nstops every day. It also has no reference to how much money you are willing to\nlose. See Chapter 5 for more on stops.\nChanging time frames\nWhat about the fractal quality of charts? Can you use ichimoku on a 60-minute\nchart, or 240-minutes? Yes, the spooky fractal quality still applies.

When you search for YouTube presentations on ichimoku, the vast major-\nity will be showing FX charts. Don’t let it bother you — ichimoku is universal and\ncan be applied to any security.\nIchimoku on time frames less than a day, however, tend to have prices much\ncloser to the cloud than the daily time frame. See Figure 18-4, the daily chart. You\nsee a moving average crossover at the arrow, which arrives just after an opening\ngap down. The price then proceeds straight through the entire cloud in a few days.\nFIGURE 18-4:\nIchimoku with\ncrossover.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nNow look at the same chart on the 60-minute time frame in Figure 18-5. This\nchart delivers the moving average crossover 10 hours before the daily chart, for an\nextra 63 points, which is more than half the average daily true range. But after\nprices have plunged straight through the cloud and out the other side, they start\ncreeping back up — twice. In fact, the second upmove is right at the top of the\ncloud when the chart ends. How to think about that? The trade is safe on the daily\nchart — the cloud is far above current prices. But you aren’t trading on the daily\nchart. What else can you consult?\nAs it happens, you can look at several things:\n» The last two candlesticks are dojis. The doji candlestick means the market\nparticipants are deeply uncertain about what’s coming next. When in doubt\nand looking for scraps of evidence, don’t neglect candlesticks as a stand-alone\nsentiment indicator. And this is despite the most recent high exceeding the\nprevious high.

You\nmay like the stochastic oscillator (see Chapter 13), because the heavy trending is\nending for the moment and the stochastic is most useful in a sideways, range-\ntrading environment, which is typical of the aftermath of a giant move and what\nis shown in Figure 18-6. The stochastic in the bottom window is crossing to the\ndownside. Therefore, don’t expect an upside breakout that would deliver a moving\naverage crossover buy signal. The evidence is cumulative — ultimate resistance at\nthe cloud top isn’t likely to break. The stop at just above there is safe.\nIchimoku doesn’t explicitly embed a reversion to the mean concept as I describe\nin Chapter 2. Ichimoku is more dynamic than mean reversion and also more com-\nplicated. A mean is a single number, albeit always a moving target, whereas ichi-\nmoku uses multiple means and jiggers them around to push them forward and\nbackward in time. A mathematician could probably tell you in how many ways\nichimoku is not a reversion to the mean theory.\nSo now harken to my comment in Chapter 16 that when you’re adding indicators\nto get confirmation of your primary “ruling” indicator, you want something with\na different theoretical basis. And a linear regression line bookended with a two\nstandard error channel is mathematically entirely different from ichimoku, as\nFigure 18-7 shows. Sure enough, most recent prices testing the cloud top are also\ntesting the channel top. A little peek above the lines is acceptable in both cases and\ndoesn’t qualify as a breakout.\nYou can easily add plain old support and resistance lines, too. If you like channels\nand waves, you can use them in conjunction with ichimoku.

You buy when\n• Price is above cloud.\n• Tenkan crosses above kijun.\n• Chikou has lots of space between itself and the price (implies strong momentum).\n• Price is at least 50 points away from farther edge of cloud in the opposite direction.\n• Entry is less than 200 points from tankan and 300 points from kijun.\nPatel also warns that you must adjust your stops every day. Patel shows multiple back-\ntests of his ichimoku trading plan. In fact, his discussion of backtesting comprises more\nthan 100 pages of a 198-page book. This is an important point: Backtesting ichimoku is\nhideously complicated and takes some computational skill. Most users won’t take the\ntime and put in the effort. But ichimoku is like all other technical analysis concepts — it\nwill fail some of the time, and to prevent getting hosed by the occasional failure, you need\nto add specific trading rules, like Patel’s list. Note you don’t change the parameters — the\n9-day, 26-day, and 52-day — but instead stipulate the number of points (or dollars) away\nfrom the conventional entry/stop/exit points ichimoku dictates to ensure they work the\nbest on your security. Most rules will result in signal delay, as Patel found in his backtests.\nCHAPTER 18 The Mind-Blowing Ichimoku 329",

The trader\nwho waits for multiple time frame confirmations on three indicators can\nclaim just as much technical validity as the guy with the itchy trigger finger\nwho has to trade every hour. The technical trader is the retired rocket scientist, the\nself-taught housewife, the cubicle programmer, and the college student. You\ncan’t tell from looking at them who is the best technical trader. The technical\ntrader may be sane and reasonable or an outright crackpot, but both types are\ntechnical traders. You’ll also run into poseurs who claim technical expertise but\nreally only know one or two things, and although those one or two things may\nwork for them, the danger is real they won’t work for you. As for the academics\nwith systems perpetually in test mode, they may be technical analysts, but they\naren’t traders.\nUntil you put cold, hard cash down on your technical trading ideas, you aren’t a\ntrader. You may be the smartest guy in three counties, but if you can’t make\nmoney trading, you’re just a smart guy, not a trader. In fact, the ability to focus is\nfar more important than brainpower in technical trading. Whatever their styles,\nsuccessful technical traders all have one thing in common — they’ve built a trad-\ning plan that uses the technical tools that suit their appetite for risk, and they\nfollow it. A plan contains not only high-probability indicators, but also money\nmanagement rules. This chapter discusses ten secrets that successful technical\ntraders utilize.

The probability of any particular pattern or indica-\ntor repeating itself — getting the same outcomes — is never 100 percent. If you\nwant to be a technical trader, you have to gather the data from your trades care-\nfully and apply expectancy rules in order to have any hope of long-run success.\nYou must keep track of your win-loss ratio and the other metrics of the expec-\ntancy formula in Chapter 5. To trade without having a positive expectancy of a\ngain is gambling. It’s not trading. You may have a slight edge from using a few\nindicators, but you don’t really have control of your trading. Position sizing and\nother aspects of money management are useful, too, but if you don’t have positive\nexpectancy on every trade, in the long run you will lose.\nBacktesting Matters\nYou need to examine the trades your indicators would have generated over some\nperiod of time — a minimum of six months, and a year is better — to get a fair\nestimate of the expected gain/loss. You have to write it down and do the arithme-\ntic. Technical analysis entails a scientific mindset and that means keeping records.\nI keep an Excel spreadsheet on every trade and update it every day.

Buy-and-\nhold is never the optimum methodology. Look back at the two big stock market\ncrashes in recent history — the tech wreck that started in March 2000 and the\nfinancial crisis collapse that started in October 2007. It took 13 years for the S&P\nto recover and hold a level above the high of March 2000; in other words, if you\nowned the entire 500 stocks in the S&P, you would have made no net gain for\n13 years. Debunking buy-and-hold is why you often see “it’s when you sell that\ncounts.” But, obviously, when you buy counts, too. You can have a so-so trend\nidentification system, but if you get in at a relative low, you will thrive, whatever\nyour holding period.\nStops Aren’t Optional\nStops are different from the embedded buy/sell signals in indicators.

You can have a so-so system but mag-\nnify it into a splendid system with clever money management alone.\n338 PART 5 The Part of Tens\n\n[Page 355]\nIN THIS CHAPTER\n» Identifying market sentiment\n» Using indicators as a guide — not as a\ncrystal ball\n20\nChapter\nTen Rules for Working\nwith Indicators\nIndicators measure market sentiment — bullish, bearish, and blah. Indicators\nare only patterns on a chart or arithmetic calculations whose value depends\nentirely on how you use them. You use indicators for many trading-related\ndecisions, including identifying a trend, knowing when to stay out of a security\nthat isn’t trending, and knowing where to place a stop loss, to name just a few.\nThis chapter offers a few tips and tools you need to maximize your use of technical\nanalysis indicators.\nDon’t Jump the Gun\nFiguring out technical analysis starts with bars, both standard bars and candle-\nsticks. To use fancy indicators before you understand bars is to rush the learning\nprocess. Think of the bar as a miniature indicator. Besides, indicators are con-\nstructed by manipulating bar components arithmetically, and indicators will be\neasier to understand after you have mastered the bar and its components. And you\ncan trade on bars alone without ever needing to dive into the intricacies of indica-\ntors. One example is trading on candlesticks alone. Many setup traders never look\nat indicators; they just look at bars.\nCHAPTER 20 Ten Rules for Working with Indicators 339",

Many setup traders never look\nat indicators; they just look at bars.\nCHAPTER 20 Ten Rules for Working with Indicators 339\n\n[Page 356]\nEvery bar tells a story about crowd behavior. Exceptional bars tell you more than\nordinary bars, but try to listen to all bars. Floor traders complain that electronic\ntrading lacks something valuable that being on the exchange floor offers — the\nnoise of the crowd. As an individual trader, you can’t hear the crowd, either, but\nas you look at bars, imagine the noise each bar must be sending out — shouts,\nhisses, groans. (See Chapter 6 for more on bar basics.)\nDefeat Your Math Gremlins\nYou don’t need to be good at math to use math-generated indicators. You may not\nunderstand how your microwave works, but you can still use it to reheat the soup.\nDon’t give up too fast. If an indicator isn’t immediately obvious, just observe it for\na while.\nIf you put in the effort and still don’t get it, don’t worry — move on. The world is\nfull of great indicators. You just need to find the ones that make sense to you. For\nexample, I never did get the hang of average directional movement (ADM) indica-\ntors. Don’t use an indicator because some self-styled expert says that it has a\ngreat track record. If you don’t understand it, it won’t work for you. Keep in mind\nthat everything works. You just need to find what works for you.\nEmbrace Patterns\nPatterns are indicators, too. Prices never move in a straight line, at least not for\nlong, and patterns can help you identify the next price move.",

Prices never move in a straight line, at least not for\nlong, and patterns can help you identify the next price move. When you see a\ndouble bottom, you can feel confident that the right trade is to buy — and this\nprinciple is true well over half the time and normally returns a gain of 40 percent.\nSome patterns are easy to identify and exploit, whereas others may elude you. As\nalways, if you can’t see it, don’t trade it. See Chapter 9 for the lowdown on\npatterns.\nPattern identification may be subjective, but it’s a handy adjunct to math-based\nindicators, especially the candlestick patterns. They can save your bacon while\nyour indicators are in the process of leading you astray.\nFinally, you don’t have to believe in elaborate theories about cycles or Fibonacci\nnumbers to use a Fibonacci retracement pattern. Many experienced traders eschew\nmath-based indicators and use only patterns, and for this reason alone, it pays to\nfind out how to see patterns.\n340 PART 5 The Part of Tens",

You can pinpoint support and resistance by using any number of\ntechniques, including hand-drawn straight lines or bands and channels created\nout of statistical measures. Momentum and relative strength indicators can help\nestimate support and resistance, too. To preserve capital, always know the sup-\nport level of your security and get out of Dodge when it’s broken.\nFollow the Breakout Principle\nThe breakout concept (which I cover in Chapters 10 through 12) is universally\nrecognized and respected. A breakout tells you that the crowd is feeling a burst of\nenergy. Whether you’re entering a new trade or exiting an existing one, trading\nin the direction of the breakout usually pays. You’ll still get zapped by failed\nbreakouts — everyone does. The reason to study successful versus failed break-\nouts is to minimize those whipsaw losses. One of the key reasons to include\nichimoku in your strategy is that it has a built-in whipsaw detector.\nWatch for Convergence and Divergence\nWhen your indicator diverges from the price, look out.

Something’s happening.\nYou may or may not be able to find out why, but divergence often spells trouble.\nConvergence is usually, but not always, comforting. (This rule refers to conver-\ngence and divergence of indicators versus price, not the internal dynamics of\nindicators like the moving average convergence/divergence, or MACD.) For more\non convergence and divergence, check out Chapter 12.\nIf your security is trending upward and the momentum indicator is pointing\ndownward, you have a divergence. The uptrend is at risk of pausing, retracing, or\neven reversing. If you’re averse to risks, exit. I know a trader who makes the buy/\nsell decision exclusively on convergence/divergence.\nLook for divergence between price and volume, too. Logically, a rising price needs\nrising volume to be sustained. The most useful divergence is a paradoxical one,\nwhere the price is falling but by less than abnormally high volume would suggest.\nThis divergence may mark the end of a major downtrend and is more reliable than\nthe percentage retracement or round numbers touted by so-called market experts.\nCHAPTER 20 Ten Rules for Working with Indicators 341",

For this reason, some traders never feel the need to perform their\nown backtests. They accept the standard parameters and put their effort into\nsomething else, like bar or pattern reading that is subjective and the very devil to\ntrack accurately and evaluate for effectiveness.\nBut if you are going to backtest indicators to refine parameters, do it right. Use a\nlarge amount of price history when testing an indicator — and don’t make the\nindicator fit history so perfectly that the minute you add fresh data, the indicator\nbecomes worthless (curve-fitting). Observing price behavior and estimating the\nrange of sensible and reasonable parameters is better than finding the perfect\nnumber. The perfect number for the future doesn’t exist.\nWhile fiddling with indicator parameters is optional, backtesting to get gain/loss\ndata and other information is not.

To do proper backtesting, you need\nyour own software or one of the advanced brokerage platforms. Even then, it’s a\nslog to master backtesting.\nAccept That Your Indicators Will Fail\nIndicators are only an approximation of market sentiment.

Don’t take it personally. Indicators are only arithmetic, not magic. Con-\nsole yourself with knowing that indicators reduce losses, and reducing losses\nhelps you meet a primary goal — to preserve capital.\nGet Over the Idea of Secret Indicators\nTechnical traders have devised thousands of patterns and math-based indicators.\nThey can be combined in an infinite variety of ways over an infinite number of\ntime frames with an infinite number of qualifying conditions. So the idea that\nsomebody has discovered a superior combination of indicators is possible. But\nnone of the indicators are secrets, and no indicator combo is going to be right all\nthe time.\nThe secret of successful trading doesn’t lie in indicators. Shut your ears to the guy\ntrying to sell you an indicator that “never fails!” Of course it fails. If it never fails,\nwhy would he sell it to you?

She is the publisher of a daily newsletter on the\nforeign exchange market, “The Strategic Currency Briefing.” Her newsletter com-\nbines technical and fundamental observations. Additionally, she publishes sepa-\nrate daily “Trader’s Advice” advisory reports for spot and futures foreign exchange\ntraders. Newsletter subscribers include central banks, investment bands, hedge\nfunds, multinational corporations, investment managers, and individuals. Before\nstarting the newsletter business, Barbara was in the credit, foreign exchange, and\nrisk-management departments at several U.S. banks, including Citibank and\nBrown Brothers Harriman. Conventional economics theory failed to generate valid\ncurrency forecast at Brown Brothers, which led her to spearhead a technical anal-\nysis system at Citibank. This decision was in 1980, long before technical analysis\nwent mainstream and at a time when it was considered at least a little crackpot.\nBarbara has a B.A. in Economics from Reed College in Portland, Oregon, and an\nM.A. in International Affairs from Columbia University. While at Citibank, she\ntraveled the world, training staff and clients on the fundamentals of foreign\nexchange, international economics, and risk management. Favorite country? Tur-\nkey.",

Technical advances\nleveled the playing field, making securities trading much more accessible\nto individuals. After the stock market crash of 2000, when many people lost\nlarge sums of money because professional advisors or mutual fund managers\ndidn’t protect their portfolio principal, investors chose one of two options —\ngetting out of the market altogether and seeking safety or finding out more\nabout how to manage their own portfolios. Many who came back into the market\nran from it again in late 2008, when the market saw its worst year since the\nGreat Depression. In 2017, the stock market roared to a high of the Dow Jones\nIndex topping 21,000. The race up the ladder continued until it reached a high of\n36,226 in December 2022, but then the next correction began. The Dow closed\nat 34,200 on November 25, 2022 — still considerably higher than the 2017 top\nof 21,000.\nThe concept of buying and holding forever died after that 2000 stock crash; it\nsaw some revival from 2004 to 2007 but then suffered another death in 2008.\nPeople today look for new ways to invest and trade. Although investors still prac-\ntice careful portfolio balancing using a buy-and-hold strategy, they look much\nmore critically at what they’re holding and are more likely to change their hold-\nings now than they were before the crash.",

Although investors still prac-\ntice careful portfolio balancing using a buy-and-hold strategy, they look much\nmore critically at what they’re holding and are more likely to change their hold-\nings now than they were before the crash. Others have gotten out of the stock\nmarket completely.\nStill others have moved on to the world of trading. Many kinds of traders ply their\nskills in the markets. The ones who like to take on the most risk and want to trade\nas a full-time business look to day trading. They never hold a position in a security\novernight. Swing traders hold their positions a bit longer, sometimes for a few\ndays or even a few weeks.\nBut we don’t focus on the riskier types of trading in this book; instead, we focus\non position trading, which involves executing trades in and out of positions and\nholding positions for a few weeks or months and maybe even a year or more,\ndepending on trends that are evident in the economy, the marketplace, and\nultimately individual stocks.\nIntroduction 1",

Most people think\nof the riskiest type of trading — day trading — whenever they hear the word\ntrader. We’re definitely not trying to show you how to day trade. Instead, we want\nto introduce you to the world of position trading, which is much safer, less risky,\nand yet a great way to build a significant portfolio.\nDon’t get the wrong idea; trading in securities always carries risks. You should\nnever trade with money that you can’t risk losing. That means trading with your\nchildren’s education savings isn’t a good idea. If you want to trade, set aside a\nportion of your savings that isn’t earmarked for any specific use and that you\nbelieve you can put at risk without ruining your lifestyle.\nObviously, we plan to show you ways to minimize risk, but we can’t promise that\nyou won’t take a loss. Even the most experienced traders, the ones who put\ntogether the best trading systems, don’t have a crystal ball and periodically get hit\nby a market shock and accompanying loss. By using the basics of fundamental and\ntechnical analyses, we show you how to minimize your risk, how to recognize\nwhen the market is ripe for a trade, how to identify which specific sectors in the\nmarket are the right places to be, how to figure out which phases economic and\nmarket cycles are in, and how to make the best use of all that knowledge.",

If you’re\nreading this book in print and want to visit one of these web pages, simply key in\nthe web address exactly as it’s noted in the text, pretending as though the line\nbreak doesn’t exist. If you’re reading this as an e-book, you’ve got it easy — just\nclick the web address to be taken directly to the web page.\nFoolish Assumptions\nWe’ve made a number of assumptions about your basic knowledge and stock-\ntrading abilities. We assume that you’re not completely new to the world of\ninvesting in stocks and that you’re familiar with the stock market and its basic\nlanguage. Although we review many key terms and phrases as we explore the\nbasics of trading, if everything you read sounds totally new to you, you probably\nneed to read a basic book on investing in stocks before trying to move on to the\nmore technical world of trading.\n2 Trading For Dummies",

How successful you become as a trader\ndepends on how well you use the tools, gather the needed information,\nand interpret the data you have. You need to develop the discipline to apply all that\nyou know about trading toward developing a winning trading strategy.\nDiscovering how to avoid getting caught up in the emotional aspects of trading —\nthe highs of a win and the lows of a loss — is key to developing a profitable\ntrading style. Trading is a business and needs to be approached with the same\nlogic you’d apply to any other business decision. Setting goals, researching your\noptions, planning and implementing your strategies, and assessing your success\nare just as important for trading as they are for any other business venture.\nIn this book, we help you traverse these hurdles, and at the same time, we\nintroduce you to the world of trading.

Investors buy stocks and hold them for\na long time — often too long, riding a stock all the way down and possibly even\nbuying more along the way. Traders, on the other hand, hold stocks for as little as\na few minutes or as long as several months, and sometimes possibly even a year\nor more. The specific amount of time depends on the type of trader you want to\nbecome.\nInvestors want to carefully balance an investment portfolio among growth stocks,\nvalue stocks, domestic stocks, and foreign stocks, along with long-, short-, and\nintermediate-term bonds. A well-balanced portfolio generally offers investors a\nsteady return of between 5 percent and 12 percent, depending on the type of\ninvestments and amount of risk they are willing to take.\nFor investors, an aggressive portfolio with a mix of 80 percent invested in stocks\nand 20 percent in bonds, if well balanced, can average as high as a 12 percent\nannual return during a 20-year period; however, in some years, the portfolio will\nbe down, and in others, it will go through periods of high growth. The opposite, a\nconservative portfolio with 20 percent invested in stocks and 80 percent in bonds,\nis likely to provide a yield on the lower end of the spectrum, closer to 4 percent.\nThe volatility and risk associated with the latter portfolio, however, would be con-\nsiderably less.",

In this book, we show you how to\nread the signals to decide when you need to be in the market, how to find the best\nsectors in which to play the market, and the best stocks within those sectors.\nSeeing Why Traders Do What They Do\nImproving your potential profit from stock transactions is obviously the key\nreason most people decide to trade.

Some\nposition traders simply stayed on the sidelines, waiting for the right time to jump\nback in. Even though they were waiting, they also carefully researched their\nopportunities, selected stocks for their watch lists, and then let technical signals\nfrom the charts they kept tell them when to get in or out of a position.\nSuccessful Trading Characteristics\nTo succeed at trading, you have to be hard on yourself and, more than likely, work\nagainst your natural tendencies, fighting the urge to prove yourself right and\naccepting the fact that you’re going to make mistakes.",

Investors still need to\ndetermine the long-term effects of the pandemic on the global economy.\nIn the U.S. the S&P 500 index peaked at 4,796 on January 3, 2022, but since that time\nhas been on a downward trend. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates because\nof an inflation surge to help cool the markets. Markets do favor low interest rate\nenvironments because they encourage growth and encourage companies to spend.\nThe U.S. is likely to enter a recession in 2022. China imposed a zero-COVID strategy in\naddition to a regulatory crackdown, leading to a decline in Chinese prices. Emerging\nmarkets were hit by the worst sell-off in decades.

Similarly, you need to know at what price you want to enter or trade into a\nposition and at what price you want to exit or trade out of a position. You may be\nsurprised to find out that you can even profit by selling a stock without ever\nowning it, in a process called shorting. We discuss these vital trading strategies in\nChapter 15.\nYou can even make money buying and selling options on stocks to simulate long\nor short stock positions. Buying an option known as a call enables you to simulate\na long stock position, in much the same way that buying an option known as a put\nenables you to simulate a short stock position. You make money on calls when the\noption-related stock rises in price, and you make money on puts when the option-\nrelated stock falls in price.\nWhen placing orders for puts and calls, you’re never guaranteed to make money,\neven when you’re right about the direction a stock will take.

The key is knowing when to hold ’em and when to fold ’em, and\nwe cover that in great detail in Chapter 12.\nOne thing that we can’t emphasize enough is that you must think of your trading\nas a business and the stocks that you hold as its inventory.

Every day, cur-\nrencies, futures, options, and bonds also are traded. Although we focus on stock\nexchanges in this chapter, we first need to briefly explain each type of market.\nStock markets\nThe stocks of almost every major U.S. corporation and many major foreign cor-\nporations are traded on a stock exchange in the United States each day. Today,\nnumerous domestic and international stock exchanges trade stocks in publicly\nheld corporations; moreover, the only major corporations not traded are those\nheld privately — usually by families or original founding partners that choose\nnot to sell shares on the public market. Forbes magazine’s top privately held\ncorporations are Cargill, Koch Industries, Publix Super Markets, and Mars.\nMany of the large private corporations not traded publicly do have provisions for\nemployee ownership of stock and must report earnings to the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC), so they straddle the line between public and\nprivate corporations.\nA share of stock is actually a portion of ownership in a given company. Few stock-\nholders own large enough stakes in a company to play a major decision-making\nrole. Instead, stockholders purchase stocks hoping that their investments rise in\nprice so that those stocks can be sold at a profit to someone else interested in\nowning a share of the company sometime in the future.",

Instead, stockholders purchase stocks hoping that their investments rise in\nprice so that those stocks can be sold at a profit to someone else interested in\nowning a share of the company sometime in the future. Investors may hold the\nstock to earn dividends, as well. Traders rarely hold the stock long enough for\ndividends to be a primary decision factor in whether to buy a stock. Therefore,\nafter the company’s initial sale of stock when it goes public, none of the money\ninvolved in stock trades goes directly into that company.\nFor the majority of this chapter, we focus on the two top stock exchanges in the\nUnited States: the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Euronext and NASDAQ (the\nNational Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system). We also\nintroduce you to the world of electronic communication networks (ECNs), on\nwhich you can trade stocks directly, thus bypassing brokers.\nFutures markets\nFutures trading actually started in Japan in the 18th century to trade rice and silk.\nThis trading instrument was first used in the United States in the 1850s for trading\ngrains and other agricultural entities. Basically, futures trading means establishing\na price for a commodity at the time of writing the financial contract. The com-\nmodity must be delivered at a specific time in the future.

You also can speculate on either side of\nthe contract, basically meaning\n» When you buy a futures contract, you’re agreeing to buy a commodity that is\nnot yet ready for sale or hasn’t yet been produced at a set price at a specific\ntime in the future.\n» When you sell a futures contract, you’re agreeing to provide a commodity that\nis not yet ready for sale or hasn’t yet been produced at a set price at a specific\ntime in the future.\nThe futures contract states the price at which you agree to pay for or sell a certain\namount of this future product when it’s delivered at a specific future date.\nAlthough most futures contracts are based on a physical commodity, the highest-\nvolume futures contracts are based on the future value of stock indexes and other\nfinancially related futures.\nUnless you’re a commercial consumer who plans to use the commodity, you won’t\nactually take delivery of or provide the commodity for which you’re trading a\nfutures contract.",

We cover these players and futures contracts in much greater depth\nin Chapter 19.\nBond markets\nBonds are actually loan instruments. Companies and governments sell bonds to\nborrow cash. If you buy a bond, you’re essentially holding a company’s debt or the\ndebt of a governmental entity. The company or government entity that sells the\nbond agrees to pay you a certain amount of interest for a specific period of time in\nexchange for the use of your money. The big difference between stocks and bonds\nis that bonds are debt obligations and stocks are equity. Stockholders actually own\na share of the corporation. Bondholders lend money to the company with no right\nof ownership. Bonds, however, are considered safer because if a company files\nbankruptcy, bondholders are paid before stockholders.

Sometime before the option period expires, a\npurchaser of an option must decide whether to exercise the option and buy\n(or sell) the asset (most commonly stocks) at the target price. Options also are a\ntype of derivative. We talk more about this investment alternative in Chapter 19.\nReviewing Stock Exchanges\nMost of this book covers stock trading, so we obviously concentrate on how the\nkey exchanges — NYSE and NASDAQ — operate and how these operations impact\nyour trading activity.\nNew York Stock Exchange (NYSE: ICE)\nThe U.S. stock market actually dates back to May 17, 1792, when 24 brokers signed\nan agreement under a buttonwood tree at what today is 58 Wall Street.

The exchange expanded its global trading capabilities after a merger with\nEuronext in 2007, which made trading in European stocks much easier.

Price swings of a stock are caused by shifts in the sup-\nply of shares available for sale and the demand created by the number of buyers\nwanting to purchase available shares.\nThe designated market makers\nDesignated market makers buffer dramatic swings by providing liquidity when\nneeded, such as when news about a company breaks. If news that has a major\nimpact on a stock’s price breaks, designated market makers buy shares or sell the\nones they hold in a company to make the trend toward a higher or lower stock\nprice more orderly. For example, if good news breaks, creating more demand for\nthe stock and overwhelming existing supply, the designated market maker\nbecomes a seller of the stock to minimize the impact of a major price increase by\nincreasing supply. The same is true when bad news strikes, creating a situation in\nwhich having more sellers than buyers drives the stock price down. In that situa-\ntion, the designated market maker becomes a buyer of the stock, easing the impact\nof the drop in price. Designated market makers operate both manually and elec-\ntronically to facilitate stock trading during market openings, closings, and periods\nof substantial trading imbalances or instability.\nThe floor brokers\nThe guys you see on the floor of the stock exchange, waving their hands wildly to\nmake trades, are the floor brokers.

These high-volume members of the exchange add liquidity to the\nmarketplace. Each SLP is assigned securities for which they are obligated to main-\ntain active trading of at least 10 percent in a trading day. SLPs must average\n10 million shares exchanged in a day.

The report called for the automation of the OTC market and gave\nthe responsibility for implementing that system to the National Association of\nSecurities Dealers (NASD).\nThe NASD began construction of the NASDAQ system in 1968, and its first trades\nwere made beginning February 8, 1971, when NASDAQ became the world’s first\nelectronic stock market.

Instead\nthey access trades using a direct-access broker. We talk more about the differences\nin Chapter 3. A new system of electronic trading that is developing is called the\nelectronic communications network (ECN).\nECNs enable buyers and sellers to meet electronically to execute trades. The trades\nare entered into the ECN systems by market makers at one of the exchanges or\nby an OTC market maker. Transactions are completed without a broker-dealer,\nsaving users the cost of commissions normally charged for more traditional forms\nof trading.\nSubscribers to ECNs include retail investors, institutional investors, market mak-\ners, and broker-dealers. ECNs are accessed through a custom terminal or by direct\nInternet connection. Orders are posted by the ECN for subscribers to view. The\nECN then matches orders for execution. In most cases, buyers and sellers main-\ntain their anonymity and do not list identifiable information in their buy or sell\norders.\nIn the last few years, ECNs have gone through consolidation. Inet was acquired by\nNASDAQ. Archipelago now operates under the NYSE umbrella as NYSE Arca\nOptions. Instinet, which serves primarily institutional traders, has an agreement\nfor after-hours trading with E*Trade.\nUnderstanding Order Types\nBuying a share of stock can be as easy as calling a broker and saying that you want\nto buy such and such stock — but you can place an order in a number of other\nways that give you better protections.

Whenever you\nplace a market order, especially if you’re seeking a large number of shares, the\nprobability is even greater that you’ll receive different prices for parts of the\norder — 100 shares at $25 and 100 shares at $25.05, for example.\nLimit order\nIf you want to avoid buying or selling stock at a price higher or lower than you\nintend, you must place a limit order rather than a market order. When placing\na limit order, you specify the price at which you’ll buy or sell. You can place\neither a buy limit order or a sell limit order. Buy limit orders can be executed only\nwhen a seller is willing to sell the stock you’re buying at the limit price or lower.\nA sell limit order can be executed only when a buyer is willing to pay your limit\nprice or higher. In other words, you set the parameters for the price that you’ll\naccept. You can’t do that with a market order.\nCHAPTER 2 Exploring Markets and Stock Exchanges 27",

For example, a hot stock piques your interest when it’s selling for $10, so\nyou decide to place a limit order to buy the stock at $10.50. By the time you call\nyour broker or input the order into your trading system, the price already has\nmoved above $10.50 and never drops back to that level — thus, your order won’t\nbe filled. On the good side, if the stock is so hot that its price skyrockets to $75,\nyou also won’t be stuck as the owner of the stock after purchasing near the $75\nhigh. That high will likely be a temporary top that quickly drops back to reality,\nwhich would force you to sell the stock at a significant loss at some point in\nthe future.\nSome firms charge more for executing a limit order than they do for a market\norder. Be sure that you understand the fee and commission structures if you\nintend to use limit orders. If your broker charges for limit orders, you may want\nto change brokers.\nStop order\nYou may also consider placing your order as a stop order, which means that when-\never the stock reaches a price that you specify, it automatically becomes a market\norder. Investors who buy using a stop order usually do so to limit potential losses\nor protect a profit. Buy stop orders are always entered at a stop price that is above\nthe current market price.\nWhen placing a sell stop order, you do so to avoid further losses or to protect a\nprofit that exists in case the stock continues on a downward trend.",

But you do risk the possibility that the\nstop-limit order may never be executed, which can happen in fast-moving\nmarkets where prices fluctuate wildly.\nFor example, you may find that deploying stop-limit orders is particularly dan-\ngerous to your portfolio, especially when bad news breaks about a stock you’re\nholding and its price drops rapidly. Although you have a stop-limit order in place,\nand the stop price is met, the movement in the market may happen so rapidly that\nthe price limit you set is missed.

How you choose a broker is based on the level of individual services you\nwant. The more services you want, the more you pay for your ability to trade.\nAs an individual, you can open your account with a brokerage house, but if you\nwork with a human being, that person is considered a broker. Brokerage houses or\nbrokerage services are also usually referred to as brokers for short.\nFor now, just be aware that on one side of the spectrum is the full-service broker\nwho does a lot of hand-holding and offers stock research and advice and other\nhuman-based services. When using a full-service broker, you pay a significant\ncommission for each stock trade. In the middle are discount brokers that offer\nfewer services but charge less per trade. On the opposite side of the spectrum are\ndirect-access brokers, who offer few human-based services and instead provide\nextensive trading platforms so you can trade electronically and access the stock-\nexchange systems directly on a real-time basis.\nExploring Types of Brokers\nand Brokerage Services\nBefore you can pick the type of broker that best fulfills your needs, you need to\nunderstand the kinds of services that each kind of broker provides.",

Most have websites you\ncan access for information, and many allow you to enter your own trades.\nHere is an example transaction fee schedule for one of the better-known full-\nservice brokers (others can be as much as twice as high):\nTransaction Size Commission Rate\n$0–$6,000 2% of principal\n$6,001–$10,000 $30 plus 1.5% of principal\n$10,001–$25,000 $80 plus 1% of principal\n$25,001–$100,000 $205 plus 1% of principal\nAlternatively, some full-service brokers do permit you to make all the trades you\nwant per year for a fee of 0.30 percent to 2.5 percent of the total assets in your\nbrokerage account. Using language common to traders, that’s 30 to 250 basis\npoints. You have to have more than $10 million in an account to get the lowest fee.\nTraders with less than $100,000 pay closer to the 2.5 percent of assets to access\nthe unlimited trading features.\nJust because you choose to use a full-service broker doesn’t mean you can just sit\nback and let your money grow after placing it into an account. Brokers make\nmoney on commissions for the exchange of stocks. If they have no transactions\nduring a given month, they don’t get paid.

Well, having direct access doesn’t guarantee that you won’t\nmiss a price, but your chances of catching those prices are better because you\ndon’t have to wait for pages to download from your broker’s server. Of course, for\nthis advantage to work for you, you must have high-speed Internet access, which\ncan include DSL, cable, or satellite access.\nWorking with a direct-access broker gives you a steady stream of raw financial\ndata — the actual trades, current bid and ask prices, trading volume, and market\nstatistics. The trading software that you load onto your computer determines how\nthis data is organized and presented on your computer monitor. Providing better\naccess is how direct-access brokers distinguish their services from other brokers.\nSoftware prices and access fees vary greatly and can cost you as much as $300 per\nmonth. The fees sometimes can be waived, especially if your trading volume is\nhigh enough — typically about 50 or more trades per month. As you can see, you\nhave to make regular trades for a direct-access broker to be more cost-effective\nthan a discount broker.

Firms can make a penny or more per share, but\nthe SEC requires the firm to inform you whether it receives payment for order flow\nwhen you first open an account and thereafter on an annual basis. Each time a\nfirm receives a payment for order flow, it must disclose that information on the\ntrade confirmation.

You don’t have to open an\naccount through a direct-access broker; some discount brokers do provide ECN\naccess. Be sure to check out the section “Choosing the Right Broker for You,” later\nin this chapter.\nKnowing the Types of Brokerage Accounts\nYou can open your brokerage accounts in a couple of different ways: as a cash\naccount or a margin account. However, if you open a margin account, you also\nmust open a cash account. You also may open separate accounts for retirement\nsavings. Because retirement accounts have more restrictions, your trading alter-\nnatives are more limited in those accounts, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing.\nYou shouldn’t be risking your retirement funds on speculative trading anyway.\nCash accounts\nThe traditional brokerage account is a cash account, which also is known as a Type 1\naccount. With a cash account, you must deposit the full cost of any purchases by\nthe settlement date of the transaction. At many brokerage houses prior to 2002,\nyou were permitted to place an order to buy stock even if the cash was not yet in\nyour account.",

Most brokers require funds to buy stocks\nto be in your cash account before you can place an order. The amount of cash you\nneed to have on deposit varies by broker; some let you open an account for as little\nas $100 or $1,000, but others require as much as $10,000 or more to open a new\ncash account.\nMargin accounts\nYou don’t have to have as much cash on hand to buy stock when you open a margin\naccount, which also is known as a Type 2 account.

Because using a margin account essentially is buying stocks or bonds\non credit, each respective brokerage firm has its own screening procedure to\ndetermine whether you qualify for the loan and can buy on margin.\nThe Federal Reserve requires a $2,000 minimum deposit to open a margin account,\nand it currently limits the amount you can borrow on margin to 50 percent of the\ninitial purchase price. Not all stocks can be bought on margin. Some brokerage\nfirms enforce even stricter margin rules, especially if you choose to invest in vola-\ntile stocks. When buying stocks on margin, you pay an interest rate on the margin\nloans, but most brokerage firms charge relatively low rates to encourage the\ntransaction business. Be sure to check out the “Margin requirements” section\nlater in this chapter.\nWhen opening a margin account, the firm also requires you to sign what’s called\na hypothecation agreement, which stipulates regulations for the account and per-\nmits the broker to have a lien on your account whenever the balance in your\naccount falls below the minimum maintenance margin (more about that in a\nmoment). The agreement also enables your broker to loan your shares to short\nsellers. That’s where shorted stock comes from.

The Internal Revenue Code limits the amount you can contribute each year\nto all retirement accounts.\nAlthough you may be able to find a brokerage firm that allows you to trade using\noptions — puts and calls, which are a type of option (see Chapter 19) — you\nnevertheless risk penalties for certain trading activities that occur in your retire-\nment account whenever the IRS determines the account is being used for trading\npurposes rather than long-term investing. Officially, the Internal Revenue Code\nprohibits the “IRA or Keogh Plan account holder from loaning money to the\naccount. Likewise, the holder cannot guarantee borrowing by the account or cover\nits losses.” That’s why margin accounts, which entail a type of borrowing, aren’t\nallowed.\nBecause these accounts are either tax-free or tax-deferred, you can’t write off\nany losses in them against any gains from investments held outside of them in\nother taxable accounts. In other words, you don’t have the same tax-planning\nchoices with IRAs or retirement accounts to offset gains and losses.

After your $20,000 purchase,\nyour account will have a cash balance of $0, an equity balance of $10,000, and a\nmargin balance of $10,000.

The math is simple: 25 percent of $13,332 is $3,333. Your\ncash balance is still $0, and your margin balance is still $10,000. Subtract $10,000\nfrom $13,332 to determine your equity balance, which is $3,332. Your equity\nbalance is less than 25 percent of your total account balance.\nWhen this occurs, your broker will call and demand additional collateral to\nsupport the outstanding margin loan. This is a margin call. You may meet your\nmargin-call requirements by depositing more cash, or you may deposit fully\npaid, unmargined securities from another account. If you don’t deposit additional\ncollateral, your broker is permitted to sell up to four times the amount of stock\nrequired to meet your margin call and may sell any of the stocks in your\nportfolio.\nIf you have more than a few positions, margin calculations become complex.

It pays to spend a little time thinking about what information you need\nnow, how you’ll use it, and what you may need in the future. With just a little\nforesight, you can set up your trading platform so it’s effective today and yet still\nbe able to upgrade without completely disrupting your day-to-day activities.\nIn this chapter, we review the basic computer hardware you need to access all\nthere is to offer for traders, explore the software options you want to consider for\nmanaging your trading activities, and discuss various trading platforms and data-\nfeed alternatives. Finally, we give you a road map to the options available on the\nInternet.\nMaking Use of Your Computer\nAlthough tracking the market and charting stock prices by hand is an excellent\nlearning exercise — it gives you a feel for the market that you can’t get by review-\ning computer-generated charts — we doubt that you’d want to travel to the local\nlibrary or your broker’s office to research the stocks that interest you. The wealth\nof online information that can help you improve your trading results is simply\nremarkable. This section lists some of the things you can do with your computer.\nIdentifying trading candidates\nWith your computer, you can do all of the following:\n» Display and interpret price charts\n» Research stocks, bonds, IPOs, options, and futures\n» Read analyst reports and company reports to the SEC\n» Screen stocks for technical or fundamental constraints\n» Monitor economic reports, earnings reports, and business news\n» Monitor market indexes, sectors, and trading statistics\n48 PART 1 Getting Started with Trading",

These charts con-\ntain useful trading information that is revealed with careful analysis. Reading,\ninterpreting, and understanding what you see in a price chart are described in\nChapters 8 through 11 (Part 3).\nThere are two kinds of online charts: real-time charts and delayed-price charts.\nAlthough the charts may be identical, the prices shown in the charts are not.\nReal-time charts display current price data updated within a few seconds of the\ntrade. Delayed-price charts don’t show the most current trades.

Analyzing the market and developing your trading plan\nare best done before the market in which you plan to make your trades opens, or\nafter it closes. Delayed-price charts are more than adequate for these planning\nand analysis activities.\nFortunately, price charts are easy to find. If your broker doesn’t provide an ade-\nquate charting package, you can find excellent charting tools on dozens of online\nsites. Most of the charts on free websites display 20-minute delayed prices. You\nmay have to pay $9.95 to $39 a month for Internet charts that update in real time\n(and put up with Internet banner ads if you have to go outside your broker’s\nenvironment).\nAt a minimum, you need control over the time frame and the types of charts\ndisplayed. For example, you probably want 1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute, and\n60-minute charts to go with daily, weekly, and monthly charts. Other features to\nlook for include these:\n» Trading volume. (It’s critical.)\n» Moving averages to show average prices over time.

It also supports direct access to all ECNs and\nstock exchanges.\nMany other charting packages are available, but these two packages are widely\nused and give you a good basis for comparing all the other available products.\nThe drawback to stand-alone charting software is the expense.

We discuss analysis of fundamental\ndata in Chapters 5, 6, and 7 (Part 2).\nMany brokers provide access to at least some fundamental data, but if you’d\nlike to run the numbers yourself, these online sources can review the raw\nfinancial data:\n» The Wall Street Journal (wsj.com): The Wall Street Journal is available online\nby subscription. It provides access to a wide variety of information including\nstock quotes, stock valuation indexes, fundamental ratios, industry compari-\nsons, insider transactions, earnings estimates, and stock analysis reports.\nDelayed-price charts are also available.\n» Edgar (sec.gov/edgar.shtml): All publicly traded companies are required\nto file 10-Q and 10-K quarterly and annual reports electronically with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through its Electronic Data\nGathering Analysis and Retrieval system (EDGAR).

Some brokers provide you with a choice. For example, Charles Schwab\noffers the integrated software-based system StreetSmart Edge or the use of web-\nbased and mobile app trading tools. TD Ameritrade offers thinkorswim in plat-\nforms for desktop, web-based and mobile trading. E*Trade offers Power E*Trade,\nwhich also has mobile platforms. You may want to try out all three and see which\none best fits the way you want to trade.\nThe approach that suits you best depends somewhat on your trading style, cost\nconsiderations, and your computer’s configuration. You may find that the level of\nservice your broker offers depends on the size of your account or your trading\nvolume. You have to balance your cost with your actual information needs.\nIntegrated trading platforms typically are direct-access systems.

Although\ndirect-access systems are offered in browser-based configurations, active day\ntraders and swing traders may require a completely integrated, direct-access\ntrading platform.\nBrowser-based trading environments\nFor most new traders, trading volume starts out relatively small, with perhaps\nfive or fewer trades each month. Your time frame for holding a position probably\nis measured in days to weeks or weeks to months. You probably won’t be making\nmany intraday trades, except to automatically exit a position after a stop price is\nhit. In that case, a browser-based trading environment certainly is good enough\nto get you started and may be all you ever need.\nThese systems may be tightly integrated or somewhat disjointed, depending on\nthe way the broker implements them. Some brokers, for example, automatically\nfill in order-entry screens with as much data as can be gleaned from your account.\nOthers make you type all the data into the order screen by hand, which can be\ncumbersome and time-consuming.

If your broker doesn’t offer\nsomething you want, you usually can find it elsewhere on the Internet, either for\nfree or for a modest fee.\nCons\nWhen compared to an integrated software solution, browser-based trading is rel-\natively slow, requiring you to open many browser windows and manually update\naccount information. Depending on how well your broker implements these sys-\ntems, a bit more typing may be necessary to enter and execute your orders.\nOn some browser-based trading platforms, your Internet session may be discon-\nnected whenever your screen is inactive for an extended period of time.

You know both can mean bad\neconomic news, but do you really understand what they mean and why\nthey happen? Regardless of what the economic gurus do, the economy\ncycles between periods of economic growth and recession. If growth becomes\noverheated, periods of inflation are likely. Inflation can also be caused when the\nvalue of the currency falls. For example, when the value of the U.S. dollar falls, it\ncauses an increase in the price of imports and commodities like oil for U.S. resi-\ndents.

When a business cycle reaches its peak, nothing is wrong\nin the economic world; businesses and investors are making plenty of money and\neveryone is happy. Unfortunately, the economy can’t exist at its peak forever. In\nthe same way that gravity eventually makes a rising object fall, a revved up econ-\nomy eventually reaches its high and begins to tumble.\nThe peak is only one of the four distinct parts of every business cycle — peak,\nrecession, trough, and expansion/recovery (see Figure 5-1). Although none of\nthese parts is designated as the beginning of a business cycle, here are the por-\ntions of the business cycle that each represents:\n» Peak: During a peak, the economy is humming along at full speed, with the\ngross domestic product (GDP — more about that later in this chapter) near its\nmaximum output and employment levels near their all-time highs. Income\nand prices are increasing, and the risk of inflation is great, if it hasn’t already\nset in. Businesses and investors are prospering and very happy.\n» Recession/contraction: As the saying goes, all good things must come to an\nend.",

Businesses and investors are prospering and very happy.\n» Recession/contraction: As the saying goes, all good things must come to an\nend. As the economy falls from its peak, employment levels begin to decline,\nproduction and output eventually decline, and wages and prices level off but\nmore than likely won’t actually fall unless the recession is a long one.\n» Trough: When a recession bottoms out, the economy levels out into a period\ncalled the trough. If this period is a prolonged one, it can become a depres-\nsion, which is a severe and prolonged recession. The most recent depression\nin the United States was in the late 1920s and 1930s. Output and employment\nstagnate, waiting for the next expansion.\n» Expansion/recovery: After the economy starts growing again, employment\nand output pick up. This period of expansion and recovery pulls the economy\noff the floor of the trough and points it back toward its next peak. During\nthis period, employment, production, and output all see increases, and the\neconomic situation again looks promising.\n66 PART 2 Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis",

Officially,\nyou don’t usually find out until months after that part of the cycle has either\nstarted or ended. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) officially\ndeclares the peaks and troughs. The NBER is responsible for formally announcing\nthe ends of peaks and troughs and signaling when a recession (end of a peak) or\nexpansion (end of a trough) starts. You can see a table explaining the peaks and\ntroughs since 1857 at www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html.\nThe NBER identified December 2007 as the peak of the most recent economic\nexpansion, but it didn’t make that pronouncement until December 2008. By the\ntime the peak was declared, the market had been in a downtrend for 15 months,\nincluding the sharp selloff in September 2008. The trough of June 2009 was not\npronounced until September 2010, and as of this writing, we’re still waiting for\nthe next peak as the United States climbs out of its worst recession since World\nWar II. The NBER determined that the recession lasted 18 months. Previously, the\nlongest postwar recessions were those of 1973 to 1975 and 1981 to 1982, both of\nwhich were 16 months long.\nAs you can see, the time lag between events and when the NBER makes its\nannouncements can be lengthy.

But it can get worse. For example, the NBER\ndeclared on November 26, 2001, that the peak of the last business cycle was\nreached March 21, 2001. That was eight months later. The end of the trough for\nthis cycle, November 2001, wasn’t announced until July 17, 2003. In other words,\nthe economy was in a period of expansion/recovery for 20 months before the\nNBER made it official. In April 2020, the NBER determined that the peak for the\ncurrent cycle was the fourth quarter of 2019. As of this writing, economy watchers\nwere waiting for official word that a recession had begun.\nUnfortunately for all concerned, information that the NBER needs to make its offi-\ncial announcements isn’t always immediately available.

As a result, before drawing any conclusions, the NBER\nmust wait until it sees a clear picture of what’s happening with the economy.\nAlthough many economists identify recessions and expansions based on at least\ntwo quarters (six months) of economic data, NBER uses its own models. Still, a\ngrowth spurt that lasts one full quarter doesn’t indicate the start of an expansion,\nnor does a decline that lasts a quarter indicate the start of a recession. Bearing that\nin mind, a time lag of at least six months is typically required before the NBER\neven considers declaring a recession or a recovery, which effectively renders the\nofficial announcement useless for traders.\nThe peak of a business cycle occurs during the last month before some key\neconomic indicators begin to fall. These indicators include employment, output,\nand new housing starts. We talk more about economic indicators and which of\nthem are critical for traders to watch in the section “Understanding Economic\nIndicators,” later in this chapter. However, because neither a recession nor a\nrecovery can be declared until enough data is accumulated, finding a way around\nthe time lag of official information is impossible.\nSignals that the economy was weakening became clear to the markets as early as\nsummer 2007, when the major indexes hit their peaks.

Just as in 2007, clear signs that the\neconomy was headed toward a recession were seen as early as the spring of 2000,\nwhich is when the NASDAQ index hit its peak and began its downward spiral. The\neffects of the recession took a bit longer to hit the other major exchanges, but they\nstarted a downward trend by the summer of 2000. Just like in 2008, job losses had\nstarted mounting by mid-2000, and many economists were already sending\nalarms that the economy was headed into a recession.\nEven though the NBER announced the official beginning of that recession as\nMarch 21, 2001, and the official end of the trough and beginning of the recov-\nery as November 2001, no significant recovery was seen in the markets until\nOctober 2002.

One way\npublic spending can surge is during a war, when government spending increases\nand companies in industries related to the war effort prosper. They often need to\nincrease hiring to fulfill government orders. Employees at these companies usu-\nally receive increases in their take-home pay and start spending that extra money.\nAs consumer optimism increases, other companies must fulfill consumers’ wants\nand needs, so production and output also increase in companies unrelated to\nnational defense.\nWhen these same factors work in reverse, the start of a recession is sure to follow.\nFor example, a cut in government spending will likely result in layoffs at related\nindustrial plants, reduced take-home pay, and finally declines in output and pro-\nduction in order to cope with reduced spending.\nIn addition to government spending, a decision by the Fed to either raise or lower\ninterest rates causes another major disturbance in the economy. When interest\nrates rise, spending slows, and that can lead to a recession. When interest rates\nare cut, spending usually goes up, and that can aid in spurring an economic\nrecovery.\nEven though the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at near zero since the\nfinancial crisis began in 2007, recovery has been very slow. The Federal Reserve\nraised the target rate to 0.75 percent in late 2016 for the first time since the finan-\ncial crises of 2007 began.",

In 2022, the Federal Reserve raised interests by 0.75 four\ntimes, and more rate increases are expected in 2023.\nAnother school of economic thought disagrees with the notion that government\npolicy or spending is responsible for changes in the business cycle. This second\ngroup of theorists believes that differences in productivity levels and consumer\ntastes are the primary forces driving the business cycle. From this point of view,\nonly businesses and consumers can drive changes in the economic cycle. These\neconomists don’t believe that governmentally driven monetary or policy changes\nimpact the cycle.\nWhich camp you believe is not critical; the key is picking up the signs of when the\neconomy is in a recession and when it’s in an expansion.

To find out what they\nmean, you first need to understand how economic cycles affect the stock market.\nBulls are people who believe that all is right with the world and the stock market\nis heading for an increase. They definitely think the economy is expanding. Bears\nare people who believe the economy is heading for a downturn and stocks will\neither stagnate or go down. A bull market is a market in which a majority of stocks\nare increasing in value, and a bear market is a market in which a majority of stocks\nare decreasing. Bears definitely believe the economy is either in a recession or\nheaded that way.\nRegardless of whether the bulls or the bears are right, you can make money as a\ntrader. The key: Identify the way the market is headed and then buy or sell into\nthat trend. During a bear market, traders make their money by selling short, or\ntaking advantage of falling prices (find out more about that in Chapter 15). Traders\nsell short by borrowing stock from their broker and then selling it with the hope\nof making a profit when the price falls.\nEven during a bear market, some stocks offer opportunities for traders to make\nmoney, including oil and gas stocks and real-estate investment trusts (REITs).\nPetroleum stocks and REITs pay higher dividends and, therefore, are most attrac-\ntive when the rest of the market is falling or showing no growth potential.",

Most of the 2.5 million job losses during the 2001 economic downturn\noccurred during late 2001 and early 2002. During 2001, the Federal Reserve cut\ninterest rates 11 times to try to ease the concerns about the upcoming recession.\nThe Fed started to raise rates in 2004 but then lowered them again in 2007 during\nthe mortgage crisis. At the time of this writing, the Fed’s funds rate (the interest\nrate the Fed charges to member banks) was 0 percent, and by 2016 the target rate\nwas just 0.25–0.50. In total, from December 2007 to early 2010, 8.7 million jobs\nwere lost. In February 2013, nonfarm payroll employment was still 3 million jobs\nlower than at the start of the recession in December 2007. Whereas employment\nhas improved since 2013, the recovery in 2016 was still seen as weak, and the\nnumber of unemployed totaled 7.6 million in February 2017.\nUtilities and finance sector stocks are the most likely to see rising prices during\nthe first part of a recession, because under those circumstances investors seek\nstocks that provide some safety (because owning them involves less risk) and pay\nhigher dividends. Gold and other valuable mineral stocks also look good to inves-\ntors seeking safety. Though the financial sector did not follow this pattern in the\n2008 recession, it is still typical to see banks, insurance companies, and invest-\nment firms perform well during the early parts of a recession.\n72 PART 2 Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis",

However, industrial productivity remains flat, and\nbusinesses won’t increase their production levels until they believe consumers are\nactually ready to spend again. Additionally, interest rates continue to drop because\nboth business and consumer spending are slow, so demand for the money weak-\nens while competition for new credit customers grows between banks and other\nfinancial institutions. During a full recession, cyclical (such as car manufacturers\nor construction-related industries) and technology stocks tend to lead the way.\nThey will likely be the companies most beaten down in a full recession, so they\nwill be good candidates to lead in the next recovery.

Every day that you open your newspaper, you see at\nleast one story about how the economy is doing based on various economic indi-\ncators. Popular indicators track employment, money supply, interest rates, hous-\ning starts, housing sales, production levels, purchasing statistics, consumer\nconfidence, and many other factors that indicate the state of the economy.\nEconomic indicators are useful to your trading. Some are definitely more useful\nthan others. We don’t have the space here to describe each of the indicators, so\ninstead, we focus on the ones that can provide you with the most help in making\nyour trading decisions.\nInterest rates\nWatching the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve\n(which includes the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of\nthe New York Federal Reserve Bank, and presidents of 4 of the other 11 Federal\nReserve Banks) and tracking what it may or may not do to interest rates is almost\na daily spectator sport in the business press. Although members of the FOMC meet\nonly eight times per year, discussions about whether the Federal Reserve will raise\nor lower interest rates serve as fodder for stories published on at least a weekly, if\nnot daily, basis.

Speeches by other members of the Fed likewise\nare carefully dissected between FOMC meetings. Most press coverage shortcuts all\nthis by saying the Fed may raise or lower interest rates.\nThe key reason for you to be concerned: A change in interest rates can have a\nmajor impact on the economy and thus on how you make trades. An increase in\nrates is likely to slow down spending, which can lead to an overall economic slow-\ndown. For the most part, when the Fed raises interest rates, it’s because the board\nbelieves the economy is overheated, which can fuel the risk of inflation. An\nincrease in interest rates can reduce spending and thus ease overheating. If, on\nthe other hand, the Fed fears an economic downturn or is trying to fuel growth\nduring a recession, the board frequently decides to cut interest rates to spur\nspending and growth.\nIn addition to following press reports covering speeches and congressional tes-\ntimony by members of the Fed, you can also get a good hint about what the Fed\nis thinking by reading the Beige Book, which is a report compiled by the 12 Federal\nReserve Banks. Summaries about current economic conditions in each of the\n12 districts are circulated to Federal Reserve Board members two weeks prior to\nthe FOMC meeting, at which monetary policy, including interest rates, is set.\nThe summaries are developed through interviews with key business leaders,\neconomists, market experts, and others familiar with each individual district.\nYou can read the Beige Book online at federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/\nbeige-book-default.htm.",

They can\nprovide an excellent overview of economic trends and possible shifts in Federal\nReserve monetary policy.\nMoney supply\nThe money supply is a key number to watch because growth in money supply can\nbe a leading indicator of inflation in situations when the money supply is greater\nthan the supply of goods. When more money than goods is around, prices are\nlikely to rise. Commodities and money traders should keep close watch over these\nthree aggregates — money supply, inflation, and goods and services.\nThe Fed tracks two monetary aggregates: M1 and M2. M1 includes money used for\npayments, such as currency in circulation plus checking accounts in banks and\nthrifts. Currency sitting in bank vaults and bank deposits at the Fed is not part of\nM1, but instead is part of the monetary base. M2 includes M1 money plus retail\nnontransaction deposits, which is money sitting in retail savings accounts and\nmoney market accounts.

When you track the money base using M2,\nyou can track the total amount of money sitting in someone’s account or circulat-\ning in the economy.\nThe Fed decided in July 2000 that it would no longer set target ranges for growth\nrates of the monetary aggregates. In the late 1970s, money supply drove the Fed’s\ndecision-making process. As money supply grew to what was considered out of\nhand, the Fed kept raising interest rates until they were so high that many believe\nthe Fed moves actually caused the recession in the early 1980s. After that time,\nmanaging interest rates became a higher priority than managing money aggre-\ngates. The Fed didn’t kill the idea of target ranges for the money supply until it\nwas certain that managing interest rates alone would help stem inflation. Now\nthat the Fed has proved interest-rate management works, it no longer sets a\ntarget for monetary aggregates.\nInflation rate\nSeveral key economic indicators point you toward ways of identifying the risk of\ninflation.

In the United States, GDP is\nreleased quarterly in three different versions. The first version, which includes\nadvance data for the previous quarter, is released at 8:30 a.m. on the last\nbusiness day of the months of January, April, July, and October. Preliminary\ndata is released a month later, and the final numbers are released a month\nafter that. GDP is important to traders because it indicates the pace at which\nthe economy is growing. In the GDP, you’ll find numbers for consumer\nspending, private domestic investment, government or public spending, and\nnet exports. Essentially, it includes all information about labor and property\ninvolving business activities inside the confines of the United States. If GDP\nfails to meet expectations set by the analysts or exceeds market expectations,\nstock prices will be affected, at least temporarily.\nFor a glimpse of what may be in store for the future, pay attention to the rate\nthat inventories are increasing.

Each type of cost\nis weighted. For example, medical costs are weighted more highly in recent\nyears because they’re rising at a faster pace, especially as the current popula-\ntion ages. In addition to the broad CPI, a core rate is issued that excludes food\nand energy, which are considered more volatile.\nThe core rate is an indicator you can watch for general price shifts. The\nfinancial markets, in general, look for a rate of increase in the range of\n1 percent to 2 percent; anything higher may be a sign of inflation and can\ncause at least a temporary shock to stock prices.

The Department of Labor\ncollects more than 100,000 prices each month from 30,000 production and\nmanufacturing firms to calculate this basket.

Serious\nconcern about the possibility of deflation takes center stage when prices start\nfalling. Deflation occurs when a sustained period of falling prices takes place. The\nGreat Depression of the 1930s was a classic period of deflation. Many economists\nbelieve that printing more money cures deflation because (as mentioned earlier in\nthe “Money supply” section) increases in the money supply normally lead to\nincreases in prices when more money is around than goods to be purchased.\nDuring periods of deflation, increasing the money supply isn’t necessarily\nthe answer. Some economists believe injecting more money into the economy is\nrisky, especially when production capacity is in excess and producers continue to\nproduce goods even though prices are falling. Whereas, in other economic\nsituations, producers commonly stop producing when prices fall.\nIn early 2004, Japan faced a continuing period of deflation even though its central\nbank had lowered rates to an effective negative interest rate and continued print-\ning money in attempts to prop up its sagging pricing structure, and yet prices\nwere continuing to drop.",

On the other hand, stock prices can rise dramatically whenever\nthe report indicates better-than-expected numbers. As is true with any shock\nto the market, changes in prices are temporary unless other indicators also exhibit\nthe same trend or tendency.\nThe reason why the employment report can drive markets so strongly is that\nthe information it contains is a timely assessment of the overall market because it\nincludes data only a few days old. This report is widely recognized as the best\nindicator of unemployment and wage pressure.

If the markets are worried\nabout growth, the growth components of GDP and other indicators will have\nthe greatest potential for moving the markets.\n4.\nKnow what the market is expecting to see in the numbers.\nThe actual number is not as critical as whether that number was expected by\nthe markets. Surprises are what move the markets.\n5.\nKnow what parts of the economic indicator are important.\nNewspapers may write headlines for shock value, but the parts of the index\nthey cover may not be critical to your decision making. For example, traders\nknow that food and energy components of the CPI are volatile, so the more\nimportant number to watch is the core CPI, which doesn’t include food and\nenergy. The news media may focus only on the more volatile number.\n6.\nDon’t overreact to a newly announced economic indicator that didn’t\nmeet market expectations.\nIndicators frequently are revised after they’re initially issued. The difference\nmay merely be related to a revision and not an indication of a shift in the\nbusiness cycle. However, be sure to check information about revisions to\nthe previous month and how those revisions have impacted the current\nmonth’s trend.\n7.\nMonitor the trends.\nOn your calendar, keep track of key components of each economic indicator\nthat you watch. Follow the trends of the most important data components to\nget a good idea of where the business cycle is headed.\nKeeping a tight watch on economic indicators is the best way for you to determine\nat what point the economy is in a new business cycle.

This chapter helps you under-\nstand critical parts of fundamental analysis and how you can use the information\ngathered from it to make better trading decisions.\nWhen starting a fundamental analysis, select an industry or business sector that\ninterests you for possible stock purchases.

For the purposes of discussion in this chapter, we look at\ntwo big players in the home-improvement retail sector: Home Depot and Lowe’s.\nIf you’ve followed the business conditions in this sector, you know that both faced\na severe downturn after the housing bubble burst in 2007. Housing still hasn’t\nfully recovered, and Home Depot didn’t build any new stores in 2016. The expan-\nsion of Lowe’s has primarily been in Canada with the purchase of Canada’s RONA.\nBefore discovering the tools of fundamental analysis, you first must understand\nhow to read key financial statements, including the critical parts of the income\nstatement, cash-flow statements, and the balance sheet.\nChecking Out the Income Statement\nThe income statement is where a company periodically reports its revenues, costs,\nand net earnings.

From the income statement, you can\ndetermine the impact of taxes, interest, and depreciation on a company’s earnings\nand forecast earnings potential.\nEvery income statement has three key sections: revenue, expenses, and income.\nThe revenue section includes all money taken into the company by selling its\nproducts or services minus any costs directly related to the sale of those products\nor services (called cost of goods sold). The expenses section includes all operating\nexpenses for the company not directly related to sales, as well as expenses for\ndepreciation (writing off the use of equipment and buildings — tangible assets),\namortization (writing off the use of patents, copyrights, and other intellectual\nproperty or intangible assets), taxes, and interest.\nThe income section includes various calculations of income. Usually you find one\ncalculation that shows earnings after operating expenses and before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation, and amortization called EBITDA. This is followed by net\nincome, which is the bottom line showing how much a company earned after all\nits costs and expenses have been deducted.

We discuss a number\nof good sources for finding fundamental information in Chapter 4.\nBoth quarterly and annual reports are important. Comparing a company’s results\non a quarter-to-quarter basis gives you an idea of how well the company is meet-\ning analysts’ expectations and its own projections. For example, looking at results\nfor the first quarter of 2017 versus the first quarter of 2016, you can see whether a\ncompany’s earnings are increasing or decreasing in a similar market environ-\nment. While for some types of companies the first quarter is generally productive,\nother types of companies, such as retail stores, depend mostly on fourth-quarter\nholiday results, so you need to know what’s expected in earnings for the various\nquarters.\nWhereas quarterly results allow you to monitor results from similar time periods,\nannual statements give you a summary for the year. You can also compare\ncurrent-year results to the results over a number of years to see at what rate the\ncompany is growing.\nRevenues\nThe first line of any income statement includes the company’s sales revenues.

Paying dividends is not a tax-deductible expense for companies that\npay them.\nIn the past, traders have preferred growth stocks that don’t pay dividends. How-\never, recent changes in the way dividends are taxed may have altered the way\ntraders view dividend-paying stocks. Dividends are taxed at the same rate as ordi-\nnary income. Qualified dividends, dividends of a U.S. stock or foreign stock that\nqualifies, are taxed at a 0 to 15 percent tax rate. To collect a qualified dividend, you\nmust hold the stock for at least 60 days prior to the ex-dividend date, which is the\ndate of record on which the shareholder will be paid. For example, if the\nex-dividend date is January 15 and you buy the stock on January 16, you’re not\nentitled to the dividends. The dividends go to the person who owns the stock on\nthe ex-dividend date.\nProfitability\nYou now can use the income statement to quickly check your company’s profit-\nability by using one or both of two ratios — the operating margin and net profit\nmargin.

In accrual accounting, sales can be included when they’re first\ncontracted, even before revenue from them is collected. Sales made on credit are\nshown even if the company still needs to collect from the customer. Expenses are\nrecorded as they’re incurred and not necessarily as they’re paid. However, the\nincome statement definitely does not show a company’s cash position. A company\nthat’s booking a high level of sales can have a stellar income statement but never-\ntheless be having trouble collecting from its customers, which may put that com-\npany in a cash-poor situation. That’s why cash-flow statements are so important.\nCHAPTER 6 Digging Into Fundamental Analysis 91",

Each\nyear, depreciation expenses are recorded for each asset using this straight-line\nmethod. Although no cash is actually paid out, the total amount of depreciation is\nadded back to the cash-flow statement.\nFor tax purposes, companies can be more creative by writing off assets much more\nquickly and thus reducing their tax burdens at the same pace.

Other methods enable\na company to depreciate assets sooner than the straight-line method, but not as\nsoon as the 100 percent permitted by Section 179.

A current ratio that’s significantly\nhigher can be a bad sign too because it can mean the company isn’t using its\nassets efficiently.

Using Yahoo! Finance, we\nfound that Home Depot’s current ratio is 1.18 and Lowe’s is 1.11.\nThe acid test, or quick ratio, is almost the same as the current ratio; however, the\nkey difference is that inventory value amounts are subtracted from current assets\nbefore dividing that result by current liabilities. Many financial institutions take\nthis extra step because inventories aren’t as easy to convert to cash. You calculate\nthe acid test ratio by:\nAcid test ratio Current assets Inventory Current liabilitties\nThe acid test ratio is primarily of interest to financial institutions thinking about\nmaking a short-term loan to a company. They look for an acid test ratio of at least\n1 to 1 before considering a company a good credit risk. Even though as a trader\nyou’re not likely to be in the business of making loans, a company that has prob-\nlems getting short-term debt is likely to have problems meeting its short-term\nobligations in the near future.

Although past performance is no guarantee about a\ncompany’s or stock’s future success, fundamental analysts believe collecting and\nanalyzing the appropriate data enables investors to make more-educated guesses\nabout a stock’s value.\nEarnings\nUsing the income statement, we’ve talked extensively about a company’s earn-\nings. Remember, the three types of earnings figures to consider are\n» Gross profit, which is calculated after considering the direct costs\nrelated to sales\n» Operating income, which shows a company’s profit after subtracting\noperating expenses\n» Net income, which is the bottom-line earnings after all expenses, taxes, and\ninterest are subtracted\nWhen you encounter discussions about earnings figures, be certain that you know\nwhich types of earnings are being discussed for the stock you’re eyeing. To be able\nto compare apples with apples, you must know that you’re using the same type of\nearnings figures.\nEarnings growth rate\nThe earnings growth rate, which shows how quickly the company is expected to\ngrow, isn’t something you calculate. What you’ll find in the fundamental-analysis\nstatistics for stocks are earnings growth rate projections made by industry ana-\nlysts based on their analysis of a company’s potential earnings. The earnings\ngrowth rate is included on all the websites that we mention in Chapter 4 that pro-\nvide fundamental statistics.

These analysts work primarily for\nbrokerage houses and other financial distribution sources where salespeople sell\nsecurities based on the analysts’ recommendations.\nThe primary purpose of sell-side analysts is providing brokerage salespeople with\ninformation to help make sales. As long as the interests of the investor, the bro-\nker, and the brokerage house are the same, sell-side analysts’ reports can be use-\nful sources of information. A conflict arises, however, when sell-side analysts are\nalso responsible for helping their brokerage houses win investment-banking\nbusiness.\nNew York State Attorney General Spitzer exposed why this conflict is a primary\nreason for all the scandals you read about regarding star analysts, such as Henry\nBlodget of Merrill Lynch, whose emails privately called stocks dogs, toast, or junk\nat the same time he and his team were publicly recommending that their custom-\ners buy the same stocks. Why do this? Well, according to Spitzer’s charges,\nBlodget’s recommendations brought in $115 million in investment banking fees\nfor Merrill Lynch, and Blodget took home $12 million in compensation.\n104 PART 2 Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis",

Analysts’ work supposedly was kept completely separate\nfrom deals that were being generated in a company’s investment-banking busi-\nness. At some point, the lines between the two broke down, and analysts were\nincluded in the process of generating deals for mergers, acquisitions, and new\nstock offerings. By writing glowing reports, analysts helped their companies sign\nmore lucrative investment banking deals, all the while putting their small inves-\ntors at great risk of losing all their money by buying the recommended stocks.\nWhen the market bubble burst in 2000, many of the stocks that were recom-\nmended because of these deals (particularly in the Internet, telecommunications,\nand other high-tech industries) dropped to being worthless, and investors lost\nbillions.\nRatings companies, such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, were exposed for\nsimilar weaknesses when the subprime mortgage crises imploded in 2008.",

Firms also must abide by a quiet period, meaning\nthey can’t issue a report on a company within 40 days after an initial public\noffering (IPO) or within 10 days after a secondary offering if the firm acted as\nmanager or co-manager of that offering.

If analysts’ compensation is based on\ngeneral investment-banking revenues, which must be disclosed in the firm’s\nresearch reports. You can review these disclosures and determine how much\nweight you want to give an analyst’s recommendations.\n» Restrictions on personal trading by analysts: Analysts and members of\ntheir households can’t invest in a company’s securities prior to the IPO if the\ncompany is in the business sector the analyst covers. They also can’t trade\nsecurities in the companies they follow for 30 days before and 5 days after\nthey issue a research report about a company.\n» Disclosures of financial interests in covered companies: Analysts\nmust disclose if they own shares in recommended companies.

In addition, analysts make projections about the\nearnings potential of the company they’re analyzing and indicate why they believe\nthose projections by including information about new products being developed\nor currently being tested at various stages of market development.\nThese reports help you track how a company is doing so you can find the gems\nthat may indicate when to expect a company to break out of a current trading\ntrend.

This rule helps level the\ninformation playing field for individual investors.\nAnalysts can no longer count on getting two or three days of lead time on major\nannouncements, which heretofore helped them inform major investors about\ncompany news. Often that amount of lead time enabled analysts to recommend\nbuy or sell decisions to their key clients, but that same practice hurt small inves-\ntors and traders who weren’t privy to the news.

In fact, one of the first stories ever told about\ntrading on insider information involved the startup of one of today’s leading financial\ninformation services — Reuters. Julius Reuter started his news service in response to\nthe desire investors had for insider information and how it could impact stock prices. In\n1849, Reuter used trained homing pigeons to fly information about closing stock prices\nfrom Europe’s mainland across the English Channel to England, thus giving his subscrib-\ners a jump on news about a stock so they’d be able to react before other, less-informed\ninvestors received the information. This story highlights a simple but powerful secret of\ninvesting: Information is power. Investors with privileged access to information hold a\ndistinct advantage over other investors who don’t have the same access.\nJust to give you an idea of how analysts used insider information more recently, here\nare a couple of examples.\n• In February 1999, during a tour of the headquarters of Compaq Computer\nCorporation, the company’s treasurer told a group of big-time investors that\nhe was concerned about softness in the software industry.",

Most of the common terminology is discussed in Chapter 6,\nincluding earnings per share (EPS), EPS growth, net income, cash, and cash equiv-\nalents, but other terms unique to the analyst call world include the following:\n» Hockey stick: When company officials say their revenues come in like a hockey\nstick, they’re not exactly talking about getting hit with a puck. Instead, they’re\ntalking about the shape of a hockey stick. What they mean is that because\nmost of their revenues are booked in the final days of the quarter, revenue\ncharts take on the appearance of a hockey stick. Most companies, in fact, book\nrevenues this way, because sales incentives are designed to encourage the\nsales force to close their contracts before the end of a quarter. Salespeople\nhave to meet their quotas, and companies planning purchases frequently delay\nthose decisions until near the end of a quarter so they can negotiate the best\ndeals when the salespeople are most desperate to make a deal. You’ve\nprobably done the same thing yourself when buying a car or other major item.\n» Lumpy: Nope, CEOs aren’t talking about poorly cooked oatmeal whenever\nthey say revenues or orders were lumpy. This term means that sales were\nuneven during the quarter, with some weeks having low order rates and\nothers having high order rates. The key is finding out why sales were lumpy\nand whether lumpy sales are normal for the company.\nCHAPTER 7 Listening to Analyst Calls 111",

The\nrun-rate is the way senior management talks about how its current perfor-\nmance can be projected over a period of time. For example, if the current\nquarter’s revenues show a $1 million monthly run-rate, then you can expect\nannual revenues to total close to $12 million. This concept may work for\ncompanies with steady earnings but not for companies whose products\nprimarily are seasonal. For example, if a retail company reports a run-rate of\n$1 million per month during the fourth quarter, which of course includes\nholiday sales, you won’t expect that performance to be indicative of a full\n12-month performance. You must be certain that you understand a com-\npany’s revenue picture before counting on run-rate numbers.\nIf you hear other terminology that you don’t understand, write it down so you can\nresearch it and understand it the next time you hear it.\nDeveloping your listening skills\nIn addition to what senior management is saying, you also need to listen to how\nthey’re saying it. If management is happy with the results, they’ll probably be\nupbeat and talking about a rosy future for the company. On the other hand, if\nmanagement isn’t so happy with the results, the mood probably will be downbeat\nand apologetic as they try to explain why the company didn’t perform as expected\nand, of course, make excuses for their failure to meet expectations.\nLearn to listen and read between the company lines.

Many buy-side analysts who attend\nanalyst calls already have a stake in the company, so they have a vested interest in\nputting a positive spin on the news. If they’re positive, they’ll likely revise their\nearnings estimates upward, which can be the first indication that they’ll recom-\nmend additional buys, and the stock may be getting ready to enter an upward\ntrend. This positive spin can give you the first sign of a good trading opportunity,\nso watch your technical analysis for any signals of a potential breakout.

For traders, technical analysis, as described\nin this chapter and in Chapters 9, 10, and 11, is the go-to. No matter what the\nstrategy, one thing is certain: Investors and traders alike are always looking for an\nedge to more accurately — and consistently — forecast price movements and\nimprove their trading results.\nAlthough some overlap exists between fundamental and technical analyses, you\nfind dyed-in-the-wool, true believers in both camps, and they argue that their way\nis best. Some even go so far as to say the other method is worse than useless. For\nour money, the truth lies between these two extremes. Both have their strengths;\nboth have their weaknesses. We argue that when you adopt elements from both\nmethodologies, you’ll find that there’s a sweet spot somewhere in the middle.\nCHAPTER 8 Seeing Is Believing: An Introduction to Technical Analysis 119",

Sometimes prices move lower. And sometimes\nprices bounce up and down within a tight trading range. When prices move higher\nor lower, we say prices are trending. The trading periods often appear to be random\nprice movements, and at times, they may actually be random. But when you zoom\nin to view the price movements within those seemingly random trading-range\nperiods, you find that the trading range is made up of many mini trends. The\ncloser you look, the less random these price movements appear. That pattern is\nthe crux of technical analysis. These concepts are important for trading and are\ncovered more fully in Chapter 10.\nAt its core, technical analysis is used to identify the periods of time during which\ntrends occur. In general, technicians want to base their trades on trending mar-\nkets. The idea is to determine when trends begin and when they end. But which\ntrend? Are you the type of trader who is interested in the little mini trends that\nmake up a trading range? Or are you most interested in trading longer-lasting\ntrends?\nThe key to technical trading, therefore, is identifying a stock’s price trend within\nthe time frame during which you want to trade.

Technical analysis is not fortune-telling; it’s simply a\ntrading tool.\nIn the following sections we present and examine arguments against a couple of\nthe more common theories about why technical analysis doesn’t work. We review\nthe random walk theory and questions raised about trading signals.\nWalking randomly\nThe random walk theory has nothing to do with hiking without a map, but instead\nis an academic theory that says stock prices are completely random. What hap-\npened to a stock yesterday has nothing to do with what happens to its price\ntomorrow.\nFurthermore, this theory claims that the market is so efficient that consistently\noutperforming broad-based market indexes is impossible.

Several challenges oppose their\nargument. No less an authority than the Federal Reserve Bank of New York pub-\nlished a study showing that using support and resistance levels (see Chapter 9)\nimproved trading results for several firms. Additionally, articles published in the\nJournal of Finance suggest that trading based on moving averages and head and\nshoulder reversal patterns outperformed the market averages. (We discuss rever-\nsal patterns in Chapter 9 and moving averages in Chapter 11.)\nOf course, these studies don’t prove that technical analysis is effective all the time.\nBut they cast doubt on the validity of the random walk theory, especially the\nassertion that technical analysis can’t be used to consistently improve results\ncompared to the market averages.\nDebating these arguments to a logical conclusion is nearly impossible.

Today, however, powerful software has\neliminated that need. In the modern, tech-driven world, a seemingly endless sup-\nply of charting tools and analysis platforms is available. For example, you’ll find a\nwide array of online charting services that can be quickly and easily accessed from\nany Internet-enabled device. Many of those tools can even be securely connected\nto your brokerage, further streamlining your trading practices. Downloadable\nsoftware is also available. These resources are discussed in greater detail in\nChapter 4.\nEven though you no longer need to create your own charts by hand, it’s still val-\nuable to understand the basic elements of a stock chart. The basic characteristics\nof a chart of stock prices are the same as those of the common charts with which\nyou’re probably familiar. Stock charts typically are made up of two axes; the\nhorizontal axis represents time, and the vertical axis represents price. One unusual\nfeature of a stock chart is that its vertical axis, the price axis, usually is shown on\nthe right, as in Figure 9-1. The most current prices are shown on the far right-hand\nside of the chart, as are the newest trading signals. You always trade while those\nsignals are on the right edge of a chart, so displaying the price axis closest to the\nmost crucial part of the chart makes sense.\nFIGURE 9-1:\nAxes of a daily\nprice chart.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n132 PART 3 Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis",

Each bar represents the results for a single trading\nperiod. On a chart that provides daily information, for example, each bar repre-\nsents the results for a single trading day. Alternatively, on a chart that provides\nintraday data, each bar could represent the results for as little as a single minute\nof trading activity.\nMost stock-price bar charts show four crucial prices on each bar:\n» Open: The price recorded for the first trade of the period\n» High: The highest price trade at any point in the trading period\n» Low: The lowest price trade at any point in the trading period\n» Close: The price recorded for the last trade of the period\nBy convention, a daily bar chart shows trades for the standard New York Stock\nExchange (NYSE) trading day — from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET — but some\ncharting packages include optional after-hours results (prices from trades that\noccur after the market closes) as part of each daily bar. Likewise, some charting\npackages omit the opening prices on intraday charts. The opening price on an\nintraday chart (almost) always is the same as the closing price for the previous\nbar, so omitting it is of little consequence.",

The opening price on an\nintraday chart (almost) always is the same as the closing price for the previous\nbar, so omitting it is of little consequence. However, omitting the opening price on\ndaily, weekly, and monthly charts diminishes a chart’s usefulness, so avoid charts\nthat don’t provide all four prices.\nFigure 9-2 shows a single OHLC price bar. The name OHLC price bar is derived from\nthe four prices the bar represents: the open, the high, the low, and the close. The\nfull range of prices traded throughout the period is shown by the vertical bar, with\nthe bottom point representing the lowest price and the top point representing the\nhighest price. The opening price is shown as a small line on the left-hand side of\nthe bar, and the closing price is shown by a similar line on the right-hand side of\nthe bar.\nThis identical format is used for all time periods. For example, an intraday chart\nmay use 1-minute bars, where each bar spans all the prices for your stock that\noccur during trades over a single minute.

On a daily chart,\ntrading volume shows the total number of shares traded throughout the day. By\nconvention, the volume is shown as a separate bar graph and usually is shown\ndirectly underneath the price chart. Figure 9-3 shows an example.\nVolume is used as a confirming indicator. In other words, if a price bar shows\nbullish activity (which is discussed later in the section “Identifying Simple\nSingle-Day Patterns”), that bullishness is confirmed by a higher-than-average\ntrading volume. However, that bullish indication may diminish if trading volume\nis lower than average.\n134 PART 3 Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis",

Significant\ntrading volume often signals that large institutional investors — mutual funds,\npension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, and others — are placing\norders to buy or sell a stock. When prices rise and volume is strong, you usually\ncan infer that institutions are accumulating positions in the stock. The reverse is\nalso true. When prices fall and trading volume is high, large institutions may be\nliquidating positions, which is considered a bearish development.\nBecause volume effectively signals demand, low-volume price changes are less\nmeaningful, from a technical perspective, than high-volume changes. That’s why\ntechnicians say, “Volume confirms price.” Ask yourself this: Would you want to\nbuy a stock that 10,000 traders are bullish about, or would you prefer a stock that\n10 million traders are bullish about?\nStockCharts.com makes it easy to start using OHLC bar charts like the one shown\nin Figure 9-3.

Con-\ntrasting colors help distinguish up days from down days. StockCharts.com, for\nexample, defaults to black for up days and red for down, but, like most charting\nservices, you can customize these colors to your liking.\nIdentifying Simple Single-Day Patterns\nThe goal of chart reading is to determine whether buyers or sellers are in control\nof the price. In a bull market, stockowners may be willing to sell, but only if they\ncan coax higher prices from buyers. That cycle drives prices up. In a bear market,\nbuyers are able to negotiate a better price when sellers are more eager to sell than\nbuyers are to buy. That cycle drives prices down.\nYou’re trying to infer the market’s underlying psychology by looking at the history\nof price movements. You can fairly infer that as prices rise, buyers are more\ninterested in buying than sellers are in selling. In a rising market, buyers must\ncontinue bidding prices higher to convince sellers to part with their shares. Rising\nprices attract additional buyers, who must continue to bid prices higher to convince\neven more reluctant sellers to part with their shares. Understanding the psychology\nbehind these market movements is the first step to profiting from them.\nSingle-bar patterns\nThe most bullish thing that a market can do is go higher. Although technicians\ntypically view each bar within the context of its neighboring bars, each individual\nbar has something to tell the careful observer. Figure 9-4, for example, shows a\nbullish single-bar pattern.\nFIGURE 9-4:\nA single\nbullish bar.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n136 PART 3 Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis",

The\nopening price of $10 is also the lowest trade for the day. The daily range shown on\nthe bar is $2, and the stock closed at $12, the high for the day.\nIf you were to keep score, the bulls gained ground and clearly are ahead for the\nday. Bears holding short positions were hurt where it hurts the most — in their\npocketbooks. A trader takes a short position by borrowing shares of stock and sell-\ning them in the hope of making money if the stock price falls. Short trades lose\nmoney if the stock’s price rises. The mechanics of selling short are described in\nChapter 15. The example in Figure 9-4 shows the stock opening at the absolute\nlow and closing at its absolute high, but the pattern nevertheless is just as bullish\nwhen the stock opens near its low and then closes near its high.\nFigure 9-5 shows a bearish single-bar pattern. The stock opened at $11.75; traded to\n$12, the high for the day; fell to $10, the daily low; and then closed at $10.25. The\nstock doesn’t have to close at its absolute low for the day for it to be bearish. Clos-\ning near the low is close enough.\nFIGURE 9-5:\nA single\nbearish bar.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nThese single-day patterns are helpful to the trader who’s trying to understand the\nmarket’s underpinnings. Whether these patterns present a trading opportunity\ndepends on the stock’s recent history and whether its trading volume confirms\nthe pattern (see the earlier section “Measuring volume”). For example, if a bullish\nbar like the one in Figure 9-4 shows at a key technical level (perhaps breaking\nthrough a well-tested resistance point) and is confirmed by high volume, its bull-\nishness sends a very meaningful signal that prices are likely to continue rising. We\ngive you several examples later in this chapter, in the section “Searching for\nTransitions,” where a bullish single-bar pattern triggers a buy signal.\nCHAPTER 9 Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really) 137",

Figure 9-6 shows a bullish single-bar reversal\nwhere the stock opens at the high, trades lower through part of the day, but by the\nclose regains all its losses and closes at its highest intraday price.\nFIGURE 9-6:\nA bullish\nreversal pattern.\n© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nDuring the early part of the trading sessions depicted in the bullish reversal pat-\ntern, buyers were willing to buy only if sellers lowered their offering (asking)\nprices.

On the other\nhand, a bearish reversal bar preceded by a rising trend may be a signal to close a\nlong trade or initiate a short position. Selling short is described in Chapter 15.\nNot all price bars, however, present specific trading opportunities.

Logue, MBA (both published by Wiley).\nFollowing trends is an effective trading strategy, especially for new traders. To\nfollow trends successfully, you first need to identify and distinguish between\nstocks, funds, and market indexes exhibiting trends and their counterparts,\ntrading within specific price ranges. Stocks are either trending up or down or\nbouncing within a range. Your job is to determine which phase it’s currently in\nand recognize when it begins to transition from one phase to another.\nDiscerning a trading range\nUltimately, a stock, fund, or index can do only one of three things: rise in an\nuptrend, fall in a downtrend, or move sideways as prices bounce up and down\nwithin a confined price range. A stock that fits the latter is said to be range bound\nor stuck in a trading range, never trading higher than the high nor lower than the\nlow during a specific time frame.

Although some subtle distinctions may exist among\nthese terms, we nevertheless use them interchangeably.\nIn general, we’re not interested in trading range-bound stocks. Trading ranges\ncan persist for long periods of time. Some may even last for years. For a position\ntrader, having money in a range-bound stock represents wasted opportunity. You\nwon’t lose money, but you won’t make any either. Although they may not be great\ntrading opportunities, range-bound stocks do make fantastic watch list candi-\ndates. Traders are interested in identifying range-bound stocks because they have\nthe potential to begin trending in either direction, up or down. We patiently watch\nthese stocks for a signal indicating the trading range may end and a trend may\nbegin, whether it’s to the upside or the downside. Stocks that break out of a long-\nlasting trading range often begin trends that can be traded profitably.\nTrading ranges are easy to spot after the fact, but anticipating when a stock is\nabout to enter or exit a trading range is nearly impossible. For this and other rea-\nsons, range-bound stocks are difficult to trade, especially for new traders. Some\nshort-term traders are able to trade range-bound stocks successfully, so it isn’t\nimpossible, but we encourage you first to become a proficient trend trader before\nattempting to trade stocks stuck in trading ranges. Tools you can use in trading-\nrange situations are described in Chapter 11. In Chapter 10, we discuss what to do\nif a stock you own stops trending and becomes range bound.\nIdentifying a trading range is best done visually. Figure 9-8 shows a chart of\nHubbell, Inc.

The closing price for the final trading\nday on this chart is $194.56, right in the middle of the stock’s range. As we discuss\nmore later in this chapter, the upper and lower bounds that define Hubbell’s trad-\ning range represent support and resistance levels.\nSpotting a trend\nNow contrast the Hubbell chart in Figure 9-8 with the chart of Chevron Corp.\n(CVX), in Figure 9-9. CVX is clearly quite different from the range-bound stock.\nNotice the steady stair-step march upward as the stock rises higher and higher.\nFIGURE 9-9:\nChevron is in a\ndistinct uptrend.\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\nEven in a strong upward trend, stocks rarely go straight up. You often see some\nreversals and mini-consolidations throughout the trend that cause the stair-\nstepped look.\nThat stair-stepped upward march is an identifying characteristic of an uptrend.\nAlthough defining it quantitatively is possible, spotting an uptrend on a chart is\neasy, and that’s the way it often is done. As long as a stock price continues to trade\nat higher highs and its new lows don’t fall below previous lows, the uptrend\nremains intact.

If you look at an intraday chart of Hubbell stock (HUBB) that spanned\nthe trading days from June 18, 2021, through August 31, 2021, HUBB appears to be\nin a strong uptrend. Then again later in the year, between October 13 and Novem-\nber 22, 2021, HUBB was on a steady climb from the bottom of its range towards the\ntop in a powerful short-term uptrend.\nYet, when you step back and observe a broader historical record of HUBB’s trading\npattern on the daily and weekly charts, you can easily see that these multiday\ntrends are actually confined within the prevailing trading range during the year.\nAlthough short-term swing traders and day traders make a living basing their\ntrading on these mini- and/or microtrends, doing so isn’t our cup of tea.

It can, for example, fall precipitously, turn on a dime, and begin heading\nhigher. In an alternate scenario, a stock can fall, bounce around in a trading range\nfor a while, and begin a new trend — up or down — as it breaks out of the trading\nrange.\nIt’s enticing when you see a stock turn on a dime from down trending to up trend-\ning, and this scenario can sometimes present profitable trading opportunities.\nHowever, this sort of V-shaped chart pattern is also difficult to identify and even\nmore difficult to base a trade on. Still, additional tools of technical analysis\ndesigned to unearth these transitions are explained in Chapters 10 and 11.\nIn our trading, we’re looking for promising opportunities based on proven pat-\nterns, seeking consistent, repeatable results instead of occasional jackpots. Rather\nthan trying to score big on sharp transitions, we recommend searching for stocks\nthat are developing strong new trends after a well-defined period of range-bound\ntrading, preferably lasting at least six to eight weeks or more. This is simply a\nmore reliable strategy with a higher probability of success.\nSupport and resistance: The keys\nto trend transitions\nThe transition from sideways, range-bound trading to defined up or down trend-\ning is relatively easy to identify visually.

It’s also the easiest to trade profitably. To\nfind the transition, you must be familiar with the concept of support and\nresistance.\nSupport is always the lower trading-range boundary. Think of support as the floor.\nResistance is always the upper trading-range boundary. Think of resistance as the\nceiling. Once a resistance level has been broken, it often turns into a future sup-\nport level. On the flip side, once a support level has been broken, it’s likely to turn\ninto a future resistance level.\nYou’ll see support and resistance used in many contexts. For example, these levels\nare used to identify a trading range, as discussed in this section. They’re also used\nto help identify when a trend has reached its end, as we discuss in Chapter 10.\nFor an example of how support and resistance levels are shown on a chart, refer\nto Figure 9-8, the chart showing HUBB stuck in a trading range. The support line\nshown on this chart is at roughly $169.00; the resistance line is shown near\n$208.00.\nCHAPTER 9 Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really) 143",

Framed another way,\nwhen sellers recognize enough buying interest at the support price, they grow less\nwilling to sell and will do so only if they can coax buyers to raise their bids. Buyers\nare now more eager to buy than the sellers are to sell; thus, the buyers are willing\nto bid a little more to complete the transaction. The result: Prices end their descent\nand begin heading higher.\nThe reverse is true as the stock’s price approaches the resistance level. Buyers\nbegin losing interest as the stock reaches elevated prices. Eager sellers must lower\ntheir offer (asking) price to complete the transaction, which causes prices to stop\nrising and begin falling.\nSupport levels and resistance levels often are determined visually by looking back\nat a stock’s price history. Knowing the specific price where levels of support and\nresistance need to be drawn is difficult, and traders may differ on exactly where to\ndraw these lines. Some choose the extreme, plotting intraday highs and lows of a\ntrading range during a specific time frame to establish those levels. Others prefer\nto use closing prices on a daily or weekly bar chart to define the upper and lower\nboundaries within the trading range.

The\nchoice is ultimately yours, but in our opinion, closing prices (or last prices) have\nmore significance and better represent the consensus of traders and investors.\nThe majority of the market’s trading volume occurs in the first and last hours of\nthe trading day; therefore, opening and closing prices generally paint a truer pic-\nture of how the majority of buyers and sellers are pricing the stock.\nTechnical analysis should never be taken as an exact science. As such, it’s often\nbetter to think of support and resistance as areas rather than specific price points\ndown to the penny.

Short-term traders may be interested in these back-and-\nforth movements, but as a position trader, you’re looking for a more substantial\ntrend.

When breaking out to the upside, you want to see the stock trade\nabove resistance at the top of its trading range by a significant amount, certainly\nmore than 5 or 10 cents. More important, you want the resistance zone to be bro-\nken on substantially higher volume than the average. Ideally, volume needs to be\nat least 50 percent higher than average. The greater the volume of the breakout,\nthe stronger the signal.\nFigure 9-11 shows a chart of Genuine Parts Co. (GPC) and is a textbook example of\na stock breaking out of a trading range. GPC had been trading within a range from\nthe fall of 2021 to July of 2022. We drew the support line at roughly $114.00 and\nthe resistance line near $140.00. The support and resistance levels were tested\nmultiple times in both 2021 and 2022.\nFIGURE 9-11:\nGenuine Parts\nCo. stock breaks\nout of its\ntrading range.\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\nOn July 19, 2022, GPC opened above its previous close, traded through the zone of\nresistance, and closed near its high of the day at $140.98.

A stock trader can endure two losses: capital and oppor-\ntunity. If you fall for bad trading signals, let your losses build, and fail to protect\nyour capital, there can be no opportunity. Without cash to invest, you have no\noptions. However, if your first objective is to protect your capital, you’ll always\nhave another opportunity.\nForetelling the future is hard. Of course hindsight tells you that buying GPC at\n$116.00 would’ve earned you more money than buying it above $140. But when\nthe price was $116.00, how could you know that GPC wouldn’t stay in its trading\nrange for many more months or years? Or how could you tell that GPC wasn’t\ngoing to break down out of the bottom of its trading range and start trending\nlower?\nIt happens. In fact, if the stock had traded below its zone of support, technical\nanalysis would’ve suggested a potential opportunity to sell GPC short.\nFine-tuning your trading-range breakout strategy\nNo two trading ranges are created equal, and it’s important to respect the differ-\nences between stronger trading-range breakouts and weaker ones.",

Waiting to see whether the stock falls back into its\ntrading range before you take a position can save you from suffering a loss in\na false breakout.

Take a long-term view\nand keep the bigger picture in mind without over-focusing on one specific trade.\nSipping from a cup and handle\nAnother widely followed transitional formation is called a cup and handle. In a cup\nand handle formation, a stock’s price levels form a rounded curving bottom that\nlooks a bit like a cup or a saucer, which often is followed by a modest shakeout\nformation that, if you use your imagination, looks a bit like the handle on a\ncoffee cup.\nFigure 9-12 shows a chart of Banner Corp. (BANR) that illustrates the cup and\nhandle formation.\nFIGURE 9-12:\nBanner Corp.\nstock prices\nshow a cup and\nhandle pattern.\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\nThe entry strategy for this pattern is similar to that used for the trading range\nbreakout.

The\nCHAPTER 9 Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really) 147\n\n[Page 166]\nstock makes a strong move up to resistance, takes a brief pause, and then continues\nupwards once more over the following few trading sessions.\nThe cup and handle is a reliable trading pattern, but that doesn’t mean the pattern\nnever fails. Nothing is ever guaranteed in the stock market, and you need an exit\nstrategy in case the pattern you’re trading fails, just like every other trade. Exit\nstrategies are discussed in Chapter 12.\nDeciding what to do with a double bottom\nAnother transition pattern that often leads to profitable trading opportunities is\nthe double bottom. Visually, a double bottom looks like a W on the chart, so it’s very\neasy to recognize. However, a double bottom doesn’t need to form a perfect W to\nbe valid. In fact, we actually prefer the right-hand trough to be a little lower than\nthe left-hand trough. When a minor new low forms, it tends to shake out the\nstock’s weakest owners, thus making it much easier for bulls to drive the price\nhigher when the stock begins to rally.\nFigure 9-13 shows a well-formed double bottom on the chart of ShockWave\nMedical Inc. (SWAV). The left-hand trough occurred at the end of 2021 and into\nearly 2022; the right-hand trough formed only a few months later in the late\nspring and early summer of 2022.\nFIGURE 9-13:\nShockWave\nMedical (SWAV)\nshows a\nwell-defined\ndouble bottom.\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n148 PART 3 Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis",

In this case, the trigger point occurs when the stock breaks above the\nmidpoint peak between the two troughs. This peak is sometimes called the pivot\npoint. Ideally, higher-than-average volume confirms the trigger.\nThe trigger price on the chart is right around $223.00, which corresponds to the\nprice levels the stock traded at during the first few weeks of April. In a sharp move\nhigher after testing the midpoint peak, the stock rockets up above resistance\naround the $245.00 range on August 9. Notice that the stock trades over 2 million\nshares that day, well above its average daily trading volume.\nAn alternative double-bottom strategy\nOne scenario where aggressive traders may want to anticipate the formation of a\ndouble-bottom pattern is when the W is particularly deep and the pivot is many\npoints away from the trough. When that happens, taking a position as the stock is\nforming the right-hand trough sometimes makes sense.\nIf the price holds near or just below the left-hand trough and volume confirms the\nreversal, then aggressive traders can enter a position.

The converse (lower highs and lower lows) is\ntrue in a downtrend. However, it’s foolish to conclude that any one break in these\npatterns represents the end of the existing trend.

With an educated understanding of trends and the right exit strate-\ngies in place, you’ll be able to better distinguish the false ends from the real rever-\nsals and trade these moves appropriately.\nDrawing trend lines to show support\nSimilar to the support and resistance lines covered in Chapter 9, trend lines can be\ndrawn across a price chart to help clearly identify the trend’s direction and slope.\nTrend lines can also uncover key price points likely to trigger short-term trading\nsignals as you monitor the progress of a trend.\nYou need only two points to define a trend line, but the more price points that\ntouch the trend line, the better.\n» In an uptrend, the line is formed by connecting at least two price lows.

Unfortunately, when the stock price closes below the trend line, you\ncan’t know whether the break represents the end of the trend or just another\nopportunity to redraw the trend line to conform to the newest price data.\nOne alternative technique for drawing a trend line reduces the ambiguity just a bit.\nInstead of drawing the trend line from left to right, the way most people instinc-\ntively do, draw the trend line backward, or from right to left. For example, if the\nstock is in an uptrend, connect the two most recent lows in the trend by drawing\na trend line backward as long as it’s meaningful, and then project the trend line\ntoward the right. This approach has a couple of benefits:\n» The slope of the trend line is more closely aligned with the most recent\ntrading data, which is more relevant to your trading decisions.\n» You’ll resign yourself to the necessity of continually redrawing your trend lines\nbased on the newest data.\nWith the online chart annotation tool at StockCharts.com, you can draw trend\nlines directly on your charts.

The two channel lines\nbound the trading prices to help you visualize the range in which the stock is trad-\ning throughout the trend.

Position traders, on the other hand, may use these same conditions\nto confirm that their existing positions are still in play. If, however, the stock\ncloses below the trend line and remains below it for longer than a day or two,\nposition traders and short-term traders must consider the possibility that the\ntrend has reached its end. At this point the stock may enter a new trading range or\neven reverse into a downtrend.\nIt may seem surprising, but an uptrending stock breaching the top channel line\nisn’t always good news. After such a move, the stock may become overextended,\nmaking it more likely to pull back sharply. At the very least, it’s an indication that\ntraders should pay close attention. In Figure 10-4, COP rose outside its top chan-\nnel line several times. In March of 2021, the stock hovered above the top of its\nchannel for multiple weeks. Eventually, however, the stock reversed back down all\nthe way to the bottom of its rising channel in August of that same year.\nTrend lines and channels work better across longer periods of time. A stock price\nthat violates a long-running, persistent trend or channel line on a weekly chart\nprovides more meaningful guidance than when it breaches a support line on a\ndaily chart or an intraday chart.\nWhen a stock breaks a short-term trend line, we believe the best practice is to step\nback one time increment to evaluate the situation.",

Gaps occur mostly on daily charts,\nsometimes on weekly charts, and rarely on intraday charts. Depending on the\ncircumstances, gaps can show continuation and reversal patterns, and they can\nsignal an opportunity to enter or exit a position.\nSome gaps are obvious and some are subtle. For example, if the opening price is\nabove the previous close but the low of the current bar is below the previous high,\nthen those bars overlap and the gap is hard to spot. Many traders simply ignore\nthat type of gap. If, however, the low of the current bar is obviously higher than\nthe high of the previous bar, that gap is clear and will draw the attention of most\ntraders. In reality, traders only focus on these obvious gaps that immediately\nstand out. Examples of clear gaps are shown in the following sections.\nGaps are divided into several broad categories based on where the gap occurs.\nThese categories determine your trading strategy and are discussed in the sections\nthat follow.\nCommon gap\nGaps that occur within a trading range, as described in Chapter 9, can be either a\ncommon gap or a breakout gap.

A breakout gap often provides excellent trading signals to enter a\nnew position, in the direction of the gap. Figure 10-5 shows an example of a\nbreakout gap from a longstanding trading range.

This type\nof gap occurs within an uptrend when the open price of the current bar is higher\nthan the close price of the previous bar. If the low of the current bar is also obvi-\nously above the high of the previous bar, this gap usually indicates that the trend\nis very strong. Continuation gaps may also occur in downtrends. The defining\ncharacteristics are opposite those of a continuation gap in an uptrend.\nFigure 10-6 shows several examples of continuation gaps in an uptrend. Some\nshort-term traders may use a continuation gap as a signal to enter a position in\nthe direction of the gap. Position traders may use this same signal to confirm that\na current trade remains in play. You sometimes see a series of continuation gaps\noccur in close proximity to each other, and these gaps usually provide strong\nconfirmation of the prevailing trend. However, continuation gaps also warrant\ncaution because they can turn into what is known as an exhaustion gap.\nExhaustion gap\nExhaustion gaps occur at or near the ends of strong trends. Unfortunately, the\ndefining characteristics for an exhaustion gap are virtually identical to those for a\ncontinuation gap. Exhaustion gaps are often accompanied by very large volume,\nwhich is one clue that the gap may not be a continuation gap.

By that time, it’s usually obvious that\nsomething is wrong with the trade, and you should exit your position.\nIn Figure 10-6, the final continuation gap could have easily turned out to be an\nexhaustion gap. Before resuming its climb to the upside, the stock actually filled\nthe initial gap and fell back to its pre-gap price level in early September. At that\npoint, the bulls regained control, and the stock moved higher. However, if that\npullback had turned out to be the start of a new downtrend for the stock, the con-\ntinuation gap would be classified as an exhaustion gap.\nFIGURE 10-6:\nContinuation\ngaps.\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\nIsland gap\nAn island gap, or an island reversal (shown in Figure 10-7), forms when a trend\nchanges direction. The pattern is actually two gaps that isolate either a single bar\nor a short series of bars from both the dominant trend and the new trend. An\nisland gap usually is a good indicator that the prior trend has been extinguished.\nYou can use an island gap to signal an exit from an existing position. You may also\nuse it to initiate a new position, but only if the direction of the new trend aligns\nwith the stock’s underlying fundamental condition.

You’ve\nalready encountered these patterns, just not by name. In a series of higher highs\nand higher lows, for example, these patterns form the basis for the higher lows.\nIn other words, the higher lows are made of flag and pennant patterns.\nA pennant pattern looks like, well, a pennant. Support and resistance lines con-\nverge into a point forming what looks like a small pennant shape. A flag pattern, on\nthe other hand, is bounded by parallel lines. All these patterns almost always fly\ncounter to the prevailing trend, but the direction in which they’re flying is not\nactually a requirement.\nFigure 10-8 shows examples of flags and pennants on the chart of a trending\nstock.\nThe key for each of these patterns is the breakout. If the breakout from the forma-\ntion is in the direction of the established trend, then the trend continues. If prices\nbreak against the dominant trend, then the trend may be over.\nFlags and pennants typically are associated with a trend, but you may also see\nthese patterns appear as a stock moves sideways within a trading range.

You may even see several occurrences of these worrisome lower\nlows and/or lower highs happen one right after the other, but then find that the\nstrong uptrend suddenly resumes.\nYou’ll see a couple of these benign multistep patterns frequently occur in the\nmidst of a strong trend, so it’s useful to watch for them. A three-step retracement\nmakes at least one lower intermittent high and one lower intermittent low.\nA five-step retracement makes two lower highs and two lower lows. Multistep\nretracements also occur during downtrends when a falling stock makes a brief,\ncountertrend series of higher highs and higher lows.\nFigure 10-9 shows an example of a five-step retracement that ultimately resolves\nin the direction of the prevailing trend.

The risk may be\nworth the reward in this case.\nChecking out a chart that covers a longer time frame can also be helpful here.

A gap that’s filled negates the trading signal that it\ngenerated.\nCHAPTER 10 Following Trends to Boost Your Probability of Success 165\n\n[Page 184]\nWhen dealing with a breakout gap, a stock that reverses, fills the gap, and falls\nback through the trading range resistance zone is likely to turn bearish. Similarly,\nwhen a continuation gap is filled, you need to consider it a failed signal and exit\nyour position. The same is true for an island gap. If prices trade back into the area\nof the isolated island, the trading signal has failed, and you need to exit your\nposition.\nDeciding whether to reverse directions\nA bear trap shows an example in which taking a position based on a failed signal\nmakes sense. If, however, you already have a position and the signal fails, it’s wise\nto exit your position. Let the market sort out its psychology without leaving your\nmoney at risk.\nYou also need to consider economic and fundamental factors when deciding how\nto handle a failed signal. Acting on a contrary signal makes sense only if economic\nand fundamental conditions support the decision.\nFor example, if a bullish signal fails and becomes a bearish signal, selling a stock\nshort makes sense only if it’s fundamentally weak and the stock’s sector is in\ndecline. Conversely, if a bear trap occurs and generates a buy signal, taking a\nposition in the stock makes sense only if its earnings are strong and growing, its\nsector is performing well, and the economy is on an upswing.\nMany inexperienced traders mistakenly think that the best course of action after\nexiting a long position is to dive headfirst into a short trade. Just because your\nanalysis says the stock is likely to stop rising doesn’t mean that a short position is\nthe smartest option. If other factors confirm that decision, it can be carefully con-\nsidered. If not, stay patient and trust that another opportunity will come along\nsoon enough.\n166 PART 3 Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis",

With greater\nreliance on Internet-ready computers, tablets, and smartphones, we’re con-\nstantly connected to the online world. This gives us endless access to a steady\nstream of financial data, news, analysis tools, and much more, something that\nwas little more than a wild dream only a decade or two ago. Thanks to technology\nimprovements, we have more methods and resources available to us as market\nparticipants. In technical analysis specifically, powerful chart indicators have\nbecome faster, easier to calculate automatically, and much more accessible to the\nindividual investor.\nHowever, the ease of calculating, modifying, testing, and using computer-\ngenerated trading tools is as much a curse as it is a blessing. New traders often\nshun visual pattern analysis, instead preferring computer-generated indicators\n(series of data points) and oscillators (which show fluctuations of data points).\nDoing so is a mistake. Although the perceived precision of these calculations\nseems to add to their allure, you nevertheless need to be aware that computer-\ngenerated analysis tools still have their flaws. These changes give you a com-\nbination of visual pattern analysis and calculated indicators and oscillators, such\nas those we discuss in this chapter.\nCHAPTER 11 Calculating Indicators and Oscillators 167",

All\nmoving averages follow a stock’s price trend but can’t predict changes. They\nreport only what has happened.\nAs its name implies, a moving average shows the average of a stock’s up-and-\ndown price movements during a specific period of time. A stock’s daily closing\nprice usually is the value being averaged, but any value on a price chart can be\ndisplayed as a moving average. Some traders, for example, prefer using the mid-\npoint between daily high and low prices for the moving average calculation,\nwhereas others prefer to use the opening price, the high, or the low. You can also\napply moving averages to other financial data, such as volume.\nYou’ll find that moving averages are used as indicators by themselves or in\nconjunction with other indicators. They’re also the building blocks for other indi-\ncators and oscillators such as the moving average convergence divergence (MACD),\ninvented by Gerald Appel in the 1960s. Before discussing how the MACD is used\n(see the section “Tracking Momentum with the MACD,” later in this chapter), we\nmust explain moving averages and how they’re calculated. Two important types\nof moving averages are described in this section.\nSimple moving average\nA simple moving average (SMA) is simple to calculate and simple to use.

To calcu-\nlate it, you add a number of prices together and then divide by the number of\nprices you added. (We explain how to use an SMA in the later section “Comparing\nSMAs and EMAs.”)\nAn example makes the SMA clearer. In this example, a nine-day moving average\nof Humana’s (HUM) closing price is calculated throughout August 2022 and then\nis plotted on a price chart. To start the SMA calculation, use the closing prices\nshown in Table 11-1. Add the first nine closing prices together, from August 1\nthrough August 11, and divide by 9. The resulting value is placed alongside the\nninth trading day, August 11. Continue for each subsequent day in the month.\nFigure 11-1 shows a bar chart of Humana, Inc. (HUM) from August 2022 through\nSeptember 2022. The thick black line superimposed on the chart’s price data rep-\nresents the simple moving average for HUM.\nTo calculate the second SMA point, add the prices from August 2 through August 12\ntogether, divide by 9, and place the result as the SMA data point next to August 12.\nAnother way to think of calculating SMAs is that you drop the oldest price in the\ncalculation and add the closing price from the next price bar.

The starting point matters. You actually need more data when\ncalculating an EMA than was used in the example in Table 11-2. In theory, you\nneed to use all the price data available for any individual stock. In practice, how-\never, that is rarely done. Some charting software enables you to specify how much\ndata is used when calculating an EMA, but most web-based charting sites do not.\nThe result: One charting vendor may calculate EMA values that differ from those\nprovided by another.\nDiscovering that you’re basing your trading decisions on an inaccurate moving\naverage is more than a bit disconcerting. This problem has less of an effect with\nshort-period calculations such as the nine-day EMA example in Table 11-2, but\nit’s especially problematic for longer-term EMA calculations. For this reason, the\nEMA is commonly reserved only for shorter-term periods. For example, many\ntraders use three moving averages on their daily charts: a short-term 20-day\nEMA, an intermediate-term 50-day SMA, and a longer-term 200-day SMA.\nReaction time\nIn general, short-term traders are more likely to employ EMAs, but position trad-\ners are more inclined to use SMAs.

The method used to calculate the SMA\ncauses it to react to price changes a bit more slowly, and that’s the trade-off for\ngetting a signal that is potentially more reliable.\nSensitivity\nAn unfortunate result of the method of calculating an SMA is that every time you\nadd a price, another price falls off the back end of the equation. In other words,\neach new SMA data point is affected by two prices, the most recent closing price\nand the oldest closing price in the calculation.

Every price ever used\nin calculating the EMA has some small effect. As an added benefit, EMA calcula-\ntions place additional weight on the most recent price.\nInterpreting and using moving averages\nTraders use moving averages to better visualize the trend of a stock and to trigger\nbuy and sell signals. In general, when a moving average slopes upward, you can\ninfer that the trend is up, and when the moving average slopes downward, the\ntrend is down. When prices cross over the chart’s moving averages, signals are\ngenerated and trends are likely to change.\nOne simple mechanical strategy that some traders employ works like this:\n» Buy when the moving average slopes upward and the closing price crosses\nabove the moving average.\n» Close the position when the price closes below the moving average.\n» Sell short when the moving average slopes downward and the closing price\ncrosses below the moving average.\n» Close the short position when the price closes above the moving average.\nAlthough simple crossover strategies like this are remarkably effective in some\ntrending situations, they’re ineffective in others.

You want the stock to\nclose below the SMA for several days, or you’d like to see another coincident sell\nsignal — perhaps one of the visual patterns we discuss in Chapter 10 — before\nexiting your position. We use a long-period SMA to provide one of several signals\nto exit from existing positions. For example, if the price closes below a relatively\nlong-term moving average and remains below it for a couple of days, we use that\nsignal to exit our position.\n176 PART 3 Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis",

When a stock is stuck in a trading range or\npulls back in a retracement, it’s difficult to know whether the buy and sell signals\nthat the moving averages generate are truly good entry or exit points. Using mul-\ntiple moving averages and thoroughly understanding the implications of their\ncrossovers is a good way to prevent falling for false signals, but ultimately, the\nsmartest strategy is to combine these tools with other indicators, chart pattern\nanalysis, fundamentals, and more. This helps you either confirm or reject the\nsignals you’re receiving from the moving averages.\nSupport and resistance factors\nIn addition to their trend-following abilities, moving averages also tend to pro-\nvide support and resistance in stock prices that are trending up or down. When a\nprice is trending higher, you often see the stock bounce off its moving average\nduring its inevitable pullbacks, only to reverse course and head higher. The same\nis true in reverse for stock prices trending lower. You often see a downtrending\nstock rally up toward its moving average and seemingly bounce off that price\nbefore heading lower. The moving average acts as an area of resistance.\nBack in Figure 11-3, the uptrending SPY approached its 50-period moving average\nin late-January, March, June, July and August of 2021.",

In each small retracement\nwithin the broader uptrend, SPY pulled back very close to its moving average\nbefore ultimately recovering back to the upside. Short-term traders use these\nopportunities to enter positions in the direction of the dominant trend. When\nmoving averages show a stock trending higher by sloping upward, for example,\nshort-term traders buy into a position when the stock price closes near or just\nbelow the moving average so they can ride the trend to sell at a higher price later\non. Position traders also can use these signals as second-chance entry points,\nwhenever they miss the first breakout. This strategy is called buying on a pullback.\nDeciding the moving average time frame\nPerhaps the most difficult decision you have to make when creating a moving\naverage is determining the length or period that best fits the situation. Regardless\nof whether you select an EMA or an SMA, shorter periods yield more signals, but\na greater percentage of those signals are false. Longer moving average periods\nyield fewer signals, but a greater percentage of those signals are true.

For us, a nine-period moving average is nearly useless. It generates\ntoo many signals that we have no intention of following. More isn’t always better.\nWe want our technical analysis tools to provide better signals, not more, because\nalthough getting good signals is important, avoiding bad signals is paramount.\nTo reiterate, we rarely use ultra short-term moving averages to generate buy\nsignals. Instead, we use a combination of short-, intermediate-, and long-period\nmoving averages to monitor the health of a trend on daily charts. Typically, we\nselect a 20-day EMA (for the short term), a 50-day SMA (for the intermediate\nterm), and a 200-day SMA (for the long term). These can change, however,\ndepending on the duration of the existing trend and prevailing economic condi-\ntions. If a trend has existed for a relatively long period of time, the 50-day SMA\ncan provide good signals as an exit indicator. However, if the economy appears to\nbe nearing a peak, as described in Chapter 5, then we tend to tighten our exit pro-\ncedures and look more toward the 20-day EMA for indications of a trend change.\nSee Chapter 13 for more on trading strategies and exit procedures.\nTraders can fall into a trap when trying to fine-tune the moving average — or any\nindicator, for that matter — for a specific stock or situation.",

Readings of more than 80 percent imply an overbought condition. Readings\nof less than 20 percent are interpreted as an oversold condition. As with most\nindicators, an overbought condition can be resolved if a stock trades lower or\nenters a period of consolidation.

At the same time, however, the stochastic\noscillator signals many overbought conditions within an uptrend and rarely gen-\nerates useful sell signals.

For example, a bearish divergence in a\ndominant uptrend is rarely a good signal to enter a short position.

After taking into consideration normal up and down price\nfluctuations (as discussed in Chapters 9 and 10), you must develop a method of\nrecognizing when a stock is not behaving the way you expected. Be prepared to\nclose a losing position before it consumes too much of your trading capital. Try to\nkeep losses below 8 to 10 percent for any position. Alternatively, you can think in\nterms of your total trading capital and try to keep the loss from any single position\nbelow 1 or 2 percent.

Managing these business\nfactors results either in profits or losses. Your primary objective, of course, is to\nmaximize profits and minimize losses. The most important step you can take in\ntreating trading as a business is thinking of the contents of your portfolio as your\ninventory.\nPsychologically, it’s important to approach your trading with a sense of profes-\nsionalism.

For many of us, it’s emotion-\nally more difficult to close a position, especially a losing position, than it is to open\nit.

You need to understand how badly\n(and quickly) things can go wrong, and how that can result in a loss of a huge\nchunk of your capital with little chance of recovering it. To illustrate, check out an\nexample of the impact that large losses can have on your money.\nImagine that you purchase XYZ stock for $10 per share. The stock falls to $9, rep-\nresenting a $1 loss. You’ve lost 10 percent of the original price of the stock. To\nrecover from that loss, the stock price must rise from $9 to $10, but notice that\n10 percent of $9 is only 90 cents. In other words, your stock must gain more than\n10 percent to recover from the initial 10 percent loss. Let’s take a quick look at the\nmath using percentages.\nTo determine the exact percentage gain required to recover the initial $1 loss,\ndivide $1 by $9 and multiply by 100:\n1 9 100 0.1111 100 11.11%\nIn other words, your $9 stock now needs to gain a little more than 11 percent to\nget back to even.\nFor losses of less than 10 percent, the required gain isn’t significantly greater than\nthe loss you’ve just experienced. However, for larger losses, the problem grows\nunmanageably. Check out Table 12-1 to see what we mean.\nTABLE 12-1 Percentage Gain Required to Recover Loss\nLoss of Percentage Gain Required to Recover Loss\n5% 5.2%\n10% 11.1%\n25% 33.3%\n50% 100%\n75% 300%\n100% Game over\n198 PART 4 Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks",

The use of percentages is a\nsimple way of accurately comparing the results of one trade with the results of\nanother — as a percentage, a $1 gain on a $10 stock is identical to a $10 gain on a\n$100 stock. The price per share is not as important as the percentage gain (or loss) or\nthe total gain (or loss). Look at it like this: If you have $1,000 in your trading account, you\ncan buy 100 shares of a $10 stock, or you can buy 10 shares of a $100 stock. If the price\nof either stock rises by 10 percent, your account total is the same in either case —\n$1,100. A 10 percent rise in a $10 stock is $1. A 10 percent rise in a $100 stock is $10.\nBut the total amount of money earned is the same in either scenario.\nIf you think in terms of percentage gains or losses, you can directly compare the results\nof one trade with that of another. The actual price of a stock, and the actual number of\npoints gained or lost, isn’t as important as the size of the move in percentage terms.\nAlthough you can buy many more shares of the lower-priced stock, it’s equally difficult\nfor either stock to move 10 percent. If you think about it like this, you’ll see that there is\nno reason to favor the lower-priced stock, even if you can buy more shares, over the\nhigher-priced stock.\nGetting a stock to go up 5 or even 10 percent is hard enough.",

It seems irrational to\nhope for a stock that’s fallen by 50 percent to quickly recover 100 percent, or for\none that’s fallen by 75 percent to ever recover 300 percent.\nSelling quickly and avoiding large losses is a better course of action. Otherwise,\nyou’ll be out of trading capital, and out of business, faster than you can say “oops.”\nSetting a target price for handling losses\nThe most important step toward protecting your principal is accepting the fact\nthat a trade has turned against you and moving on. You can’t afford to hesitate to\nsell a loser. Hesitation to exit a losing trade allows small losses to quickly become\nlarge ones. Before entering a trade, make sure you set a target price that you’re\nwilling to initially pay for the stock, and set a lower stop target where you’re will-\ning to sell in case the trade results in a loss.\nSetting a stop-loss price (or, as traders say, setting your stop) has no single for-\nmula.

As discussed in\nChapter 9, your entry point for this trade occurs above $47.17 when the ETF breaks\nthrough its resistance level. But how do you handle the trade if it doesn’t work out? Or\nperhaps a better question to ask is this: How do you know when the trade has failed?\n» One of several approaches suggests that if the breakout fails (the price pulls\nback below its resistance level), you need to exit your position immediately.\nFor the XME example in Figure 12-1, if the ETF were to fall below the resis-\ntance line ($47.17) after it breaks out above it, you should exit. The failed\nbreakout may signal that there is some bullish pressure behind the stock\nand it’s worth keeping an eye on, but the trade is off for the time being.\n» Another approach suggests that if the ETF falls below the midpoint of its\ntrading range, in this case somewhere around $43.22, then the breakout\nbuy signal has failed. In that case, you can use any price below $43.22 as the\nstop-loss price to exit from the position.\n200 PART 4 Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks",

As long as both your entry and exit\norders are filled at good prices, your risk should be no more than $1.00 per share,\nwhich reflects a maximum loss of just over 2.1 percent on the trade. We discuss\nfills further in Chapter 16.\nIn the second approach, the risk is greater. The difference between the $47.17\nbreakout price and the $43.22 stop-loss price is $3.95. However, the strength\nof the ETF’s breakout move means that your actual fill price may be closer to\n$48.00 or more, resulting in a greater percentage risk on the trade (closer to\n9.95 percent). Poor fills on either entry or exit orders increase the amount of\ncapital at risk.\nThe trade-off between the two approaches is clear. The first one risks a smaller\namount before triggering the exit trade, but it’s prone to whipsaws. This means\nthat you may be forced out of a potentially winning trade as it simply makes a\nhealthy retest of its former resistance level. The second approach risks a greater\namount but is less prone to whipsaws. Position traders who expect to hold a trade\nfor several weeks or months are more likely to choose the second.\nEither approach is rational, so you need to choose the one more closely aligned\nwith your personal risk tolerance. If you start second-guessing your stop-loss\npoints, they’re no longer useful, so be sure to use an approach that you’ll honor.\nUsing the first approach may make more sense for new position traders because\ntight stops can serve as educational tools.",

Ultimately, it’s crucial to\ndetermine the amount of risk you’re willing to take on as a trader. What is com-\nfortable for another trader may be excessive for your own personality, or vice\nversa. Be honest with yourself and adopt a stop setting system that truly fits your\nunique investing profile.\nStrategies for managing profitable trades\nProfitable trades are somewhat easier to manage than losses, but they’re not\nwithout complications. You must carefully adjust your stops as the price rises in\norder to lock in some of your gains on paper, and eventually decide when to take\nprofits for real and exit out of the winning trade.\nYou obviously want to try to keep any profit from turning into a loss. For example,\nsay that you enter the XME trade in the Figure 12-1 scenario, and a few days after\nentering the order it remains in positive territory with a small profit. For this\ndiscussion, assume that your original stop price is $43.22, the midpoint of the\ntrading range. Your choice is to leave the stop where it is or move it above the\nresistance line, to $47.18.\nCHAPTER 12 Money Management Techniques: Building a More Robust Portfolio 201",

This balancing act is delicate. You’re trying to catch the bigger move of\nthe larger trend, which argues for leaving the stop where it is for a little while\nlonger. But sooner rather than later, you’ll want to move your stop-loss above\nyour entry price. This decision becomes easier as the position progresses. As your\nprofit grows, you’ll want to continue adjusting your exit points upward.

After a brief pullback, the stock failed to\nbreak its prior high in mid-December. A second test only a few weeks later at the\nend of December was followed by another sharp move down and a break to new\nlows. As the calendar rolled over to 2022, every attempted rally in MSFT quickly\nstalled, met only by another wave of selling that pushed the stock to lower lows.\nIn addition, many of these moves against the longstanding uptrend came on\nhigher-than-average volume.\nWhen a stock clearly breaks its pattern of higher highs and higher lows, the\nsmartest move is to exit the position. Trends resume, and a broken pattern is not\nalways a surefire sign that the uptrend has run out of steam. However, trading is\nabout managing risk. When an uptrend is broken, the risk of a strong move to the\ndownside grows significantly. Your primary objectives at this point should be to\nlimit your risk exposure and protect your capital.\nUsing trailing stops\nAfter you’ve entered a position and it becomes profitable, you want to adjust your\nstop to protect your profits.

The three general categories are market risks, invest-\nment risks, and trading risks.\nMarket risks\nFor the most part, market risks are out of your control. Of course you know the\nrisk that the markets are bound to rise and fall, but understanding the risks you\nface when they do helps you manage your money better. Three key risks that you\ncan manage as a trader are\n» Inflation risk: This describes the risk that your money won’t grow fast enough\nto exceed the cost increases caused by inflation. Basic goods and services\nsuch as housing, clothing, medical expenses, and food increase in price each\nyear. If you invest in monetary vehicles that don’t keep pace with inflation, you\nactually end up losing money. Although inflation is a risk that stock traders\nrarely consider, it nevertheless impacts investors who are risk-averse.\nCHAPTER 12 Money Management Techniques: Building a More Robust Portfolio 205",

If\nyou’re restricted from selling an investment when you want to do so, your\ntarget selling point is irrelevant. For most stock traders, this factor isn’t an\nissue, but if, for example, you choose to invest in a small company whose\nstock isn’t traded on one of the major exchanges, you risk not being able to\nclose your position when the time is right. Many small-cap stocks or penny\nstocks with low trading volume can also suffer from low liquidity that affects\nyour ability to sell.\n» Currency translation risk: Currency translation refers to disparities in\ntrading stocks of companies in foreign countries. It’s only a factor when you\ntrade foreign stocks because you then must be concerned with fluctuations\nbetween the values of your local currency and the currency in the country\nwhere the company is located. Even if the stock increases in price, you can\nstill lose money based on the currency exchange rate. If the value of your\ncurrency falls against the other currency, your investment can be worth less\nwhen you convert it back.\nInvestment risks\nInvestment risks relate directly to how you invest your money and manage your\nentry and exit trades. Two critical risks you must manage are\n» Opportunity risk: Also known as opportunity cost, this kind of risk involves\nbalancing your trade-offs. When you trade, you establish a position that ties\nup money that otherwise can be used elsewhere.",

Essentially, you can miss other\nopportunities while your money is tied up in another position.\n» Concentration risk: This kind of risk happens when you put too many eggs in\none basket. You may think you’ve found the miracle stock that’s going to make\nyou a millionaire, so you decide to invest a huge portion of your principal into\nthat one position. By concentrating so much of your money on one invest-\nment, you also disproportionally expose yourself to the risks associated with\nthat one specific investment.

(See Chapters 17 and 18 for more information about swing trad-\ning and day trading, respectively.) Risks associated with trading are\n» Slippage risk: This risk considers the hidden costs associated with every\ntransaction. Each time you enter or exit a position, your account balance\nshrinks by a small amount due to the stock’s bid-ask spread. Buy orders are\nexecuted at the ask price (the lowest price available for the stock that you\nwant), whereas sell orders are executed at the bid price (the highest price\nsomeone is willing to pay for shares you own). Unfortunately, the bid price is\nalways less than the ask price. The difference between the two is referred to\nas the stock’s bid-ask spread. For example, if the current quote for a stock is\n$20.50/$20.55, a buyer would pay the ask price of $20.55, and a seller would\nreceive the bid price of $20.50. If you bought one share of the stock and then\nimmediately sold it, you would instantly lose $0.05 on the trade.

The amounts for each trade may at\nfirst seem small, but as your trading volume increases, so do the amounts you\nlose to slippage.\n» Poor execution risk: This problem occurs whenever your broker has a\ndifficult time filling your order, which can result from any number of factors,\nincluding fast market conditions, poor availability of stock, and the absence of\nother buyers and sellers. The result is always the same: The price you expect\ndiffers from the price you actually receive. Although you can mitigate this\nproblem to a degree by using limit orders, you still risk the stock trading\nthrough your limit price, preventing your order from being filled at all.\n» Gap risk: This risk comes into play whenever a break in trading occurs.\nSometimes a stock opens at a price significantly higher or lower than its\nprevious close. When this happens, the stock can trade right through your\ntarget exit price or your stop. For example, a stock may close at $25 a share\ntoday and open tomorrow morning at $20. If you’ve entered a stop order to\nexit you out of the trade at a price of $24, the order is likely to be filled at the\n$20 opening price or lower, clearing your stop entirely.

Low interest rates are associated\nwith economic troughs, and high rates with economic peaks. In a nutshell, the Fed\nlowers rates to stimulate economic activity and raises rates to slow it. But the time\nlag between the Fed’s activity and any reaction by the economy is often a long one,\nmaking the Fed’s monetary policy an imprecise indicator. Nevertheless, you can\nuse interest rates to get a rough idea about the current economic landscape.\nInterest-rate reductions that the Fed approves are generally good news for the\nstock market. And when the Fed tightens its monetary policy by raising interest\nrates, stocks normally react poorly. Either way, stock markets may not react\nimmediately, and unfortunately, many months can pass before either the stock\nmarket or the economy responds in either direction to the Fed’s action. Although\nthe old stock market saying “three steps and a stumble” doesn’t always hold true,\nmarkets do often head lower after the Fed raises rates for the third time.\nIn short, falling interest rates typically lead to a rising economy and to a market\nthat’s changing from a bear market to a bull market — in other words, a bullish\ntransition.

In short, think of it this way: In a strong econ-\nomy, when consumers have more disposable income, they’re more likely to spend\non superfluous goods such as clothes, cars, a new TV, or a night at a fancy hotel.\nWhen the economy contracts, however, and those same consumers have less cash\non hand, they’re more likely to spend only on the basic essentials, such as tooth-\npaste, food, and their electricity bills.\nThe stocks of cyclical and technology-based companies perform best when inter-\nest rates are low. Increased sales of their products drive industrial production\nnumbers higher. These companies usually lead the market and often rally before\nan economic trough, or recession, completely bottoms out. Unfortunately, traders\njump the gun as often as they get it right, so whenever you see cyclical and tech\nstocks begin to rally, it pays to be at least slightly skeptical.

Remembering that bull markets tend to lift prices\nfor all stocks is also important. When you monitor sector performance, try to find\nthe sectors that are outperforming others. In bear markets, stocks that hold their\nvalues, for example, outperform all stocks that have falling prices.\nFinding the dominant trend\nYou need to own stocks during bull markets and sell them, or short them (see\nChapter 15), during bear markets. In other words, you want to trade with the\ndominant trend, not against it. The stock market tends to lead the economy, so\nusing the market’s performance as your primary reference to find the dominant\ntrend makes sense.

We use two, the weekly charts of broad market indexes and the bullish\npercent index, which is discussed in the next section. Significant changes in the\nmarkets develop more slowly than in individual stocks and thus appear more\nclearly on weekly charts than on daily charts. Weekly charts help filter out finan-\ncial noise, allowing you to focus less on the insignificant day-to-day price moves\nand more on the bigger picture.\nWe typically monitor charts of the major indexes such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average, the NASDAQ Composite Index, and the Russell 2000 Index.\nDoing so makes visually identifying bull markets and bear markets easy. They\nappear as trends, exactly like the ones shown on the stock charts in Chapter 10.\nA bull market appears as a series of higher highs and higher lows on weekly index\ncharts. A bear market appears as a series of lower highs and lower lows. These are\nthe dominant trends.\nPullback patterns, such as the flag, pennant, and other retracement patterns dis-\ncussed in Chapter 10, correspond to the bullish pullback and bearish pullback con-\nditions. And bullish transition and bearish transition phases may signal a trend\nreversal in much the same way that reversal patterns and trading ranges often\nlead to a change in direction.\nFigure 13-3 shows the phases of a bull market using a weekly chart of the S&P 500\nIndex.",

The BPI is a powerful indicator that\nshows the percentage of stocks that have generated buy signals compared with\nthe total number of stocks in a given index. In short, it provides a simple yet\neffective way to analyze market participation, which can in turn be used to judge\nthe strength of the market’s trend. In a strong bull market, for example, a large\npercentage of stocks participate in the upward rally. The idea here is simple: If\nevery stock in the market is rising, the strength of that trend is more power-\nful than if only 55 percent of stocks are rising. In a bear market, the opposite\nis true. The greater the percentage of stocks declining — participating in the\ndowntrend — the weaker the market.\nThis indicator originally was used to track all the stocks on the NYSE, but it can\nalso be applied to any broad market index, including the S&P 500, the NASDAQ\nComposite, or even the more narrowly defined NASDAQ 100 and sector indexes.\nThe BPI does, however, provide fewer and better signals when evaluating larger\ngroups of stocks.\nCHAPTER 13 Combining Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy 219",

Calculating the BPI is a bit daunting, but fortunately, it’s published online.\nFor example, you can find BPIs at StockCharts.com, where the current states of\nthis indicator for the major indexes and several sector indexes are displayed and\ninterpreted. You can find more information about creating BPI charts online in the\nChartSchool section of StockCharts.com. Just click on ChartSchool at the top of the\nwebpage.\nAs an indicator, BPI works a bit like an oscillator (see Chapter 11). It displays val-\nues ranging from 0 to 100 percent to identify oversold and overbought market\nconditions. For example, when fewer than 30 percent of all stocks are on a buy\nsignal, the BPI indicates that the market is becoming oversold and is more likely\nto experience a turnaround. When more than 70 percent of all stocks signal a buy,\nthe BPI shows the market is becoming overbought and is more likely to experience\na downturn.\nHowever, like individual stocks, broad market indexes can remain overbought or\noversold for extended periods of time, so by themselves, BPI readings below\n30 percent or above 70 percent don’t necessarily represent immediate buy or sell\nsignals, respectively. The BPI can often show readings well above 70 percent and\nwell below 30 percent for extended periods of time.",

As with most other financial\nanalysis tools, it is the pairing of the BPI with other technical indicators, market\nstatistics, and fundamental data that makes it a powerful addition to your invest-\ning strategy.\nChanges in BPI levels are triggered by reversal patterns. A 6 percent change in the\nstocks of a given index is required to trigger any changes (up or down) in the\nBPI. These reversal patterns are interpreted to describe the state of the market\nusing six unique conditions that roughly correspond with the six phases of the\nmarket described in the introduction to this chapter. Here are the six states of\nthe BPI:\n» Bull alert: Corresponds with the bullish transition phase. It’s triggered\nwhen the BPI is less than 30 percent and reverses direction when 6 percent\n(or more) of all stocks change to buy signals.\n» Bull confirmed: Corresponds with the bull market phase.

When used with broad-based indexes, the BPI doesn’t speak\noften. After all, more than 2,800 stocks are traded on the NYSE. For the BPI to\nregister a reversal, at least 6 percent (or approximately 168) of those stocks must\nchange from a buy signal to a sell signal (or vice versa). Technically, the distinc-\ntion is a bit more subtle than that. A total of 168 more stocks must change to sell\nsignals than are changing to buy signals for the index to change from bull con-\nfirmed to bull correction conditions.\nThe BPI for smaller stock indexes generates considerably more signals.\nA 6 percent change on the NASDAQ 100 requires only a balance of six stocks to\nchange from buy to sell signals.

When you buy an ETF, you buy an index fund that tries to match the per-\nformance of that index. Most ETFs are passive trading tools that try to match\nrather than beat an index.\nIn the following sections, we outline the benefits and drawbacks of ETFs so you\nknow what you have to pay attention to if you invest in them.\nExamining the advantages\nYou may wonder why using an ETF is a good thing for sector rotation trading. The\nkey advantage is that these funds allow you to actively manage your portfolio\nbased on your analysis of the current sector rotation environment, but without\nhaving to take on extra risk from individual stock picks. Plus, there’s no need to\nworry about an active mutual fund manager making trades that negate the sector\nrotation analysis because ETFs are passively managed. When you buy a sector\nETF, you know exactly what you’re getting.\nETFs offer you a number of advantages:\n» Minimal managerial risk: The fund manager makes only minor periodic\nadjustments to keep the fund in line with its index, which mitigates the\nelement of managerial risk. You’re harnessing the power of the index you\nchoose, making it easier to control exactly where your money is invested.\n» Fewer (and lower) management fees: Because trading is minimal, the\nmanagement costs of ETFs are low, so less of your money goes toward fees.\n» Diversification: By spreading your investment across a wider number of\nstocks, ETFs keep your portfolio more diversified.",

You can buy and sell ETFs\nthroughout the trading day. Rapid trading triggers no penalties. You can use\nmarket orders, limit orders, stop orders, and stop-limit orders. And, unlike a\ntraditional mutual fund, you can short shares of an ETF. They can also be\nbought on margin.

Although you may not have difficulty finding an\nETF that tracks exactly what you want, you do need to understand how that ETF\nbuilds its portfolios (check out the later section “Does Family Matter?” for more\non this topic).\nAvoiding the flaws\nETFs can be a great way to minimize risk while effectively implementing a sector\nrotation trading strategy, but they do have some faults that shouldn’t be ignored:\n» Fees: Every ETF charges fees. Always be sure you understand the fees and\ncarefully compare the options you’re considering.\n» Volatility: ETFs can be volatile, particularly as you start trading funds with\nmore specific benchmarks such as industry group ETFs that track gambling\nstocks or apparel retailers. The narrower the focus of the fund, the more\nvolatility it will bring. For example, an ETF that tracks a broad market index will\nbe less volatile than an ETF that tracks a particular sector or industry group. If\nyou pick an oil and gas ETF, it can fall just as hard as any oil or gas stock when\nthe entire industry takes a sharp downturn.\n» Liquidity: Although many ETFs offer high volume and high liquidity, the\ndramatic expansion of the ETF market in recent years has also resulted in a\nlarge number of newer, more thinly traded funds with lower liquidity.

In the following sections, we take a\nlook at how each of the weighting options can impact the ETFs you choose.\nMarket-weighted ETFs\nMarket-weighted ETFs are based on market capitalization and their underlying\nsectors. This type of weighting gives you a good exposure to the overall U.S.\neconomy and the sectors in it. They’re biased toward large-cap stocks and don’t\nprovide much exposure to small-cap stocks (which tend to be more volatile).\nBecause many sectors have only a few companies that are large- or mega-cap\nstocks, these types of ETFs can be concentrated in only a few companies. ETFs are\navailable for each of the eleven major market sectors — consumer discretionary,\nconsumer staples, energy, financials, healthcare, industrials, technology, mate-\nrials, real estate, communication services, and utilities — as well as the smaller\nindustry groups within those sectors.\nAs you’re building your portfolio, you should research the indexes each ETF family\nuses and be sure that the choice of index matches your trading goals. Generally we\nrecommend picking one family of ETFs and sticking with that family to avoid\nunwanted duplication. Also, this practice will ensure that you’re building a port-\nfolio with the sectors you intend to use.\nTwo of the largest families managing market-weighted ETFs are iShares (managed\nby BlackRock) and State Street Global Advisors.

The managers of\nthese ETFs use the Industrial Classification Benchmark (ICB) system to determine\nthe compositions of each sector and subsector. The ICB classifications were jointly\ndeveloped by Dow Jones and the British indexer FTSE. (FTSE also develops indexes\nfor many country-based stock exchanges, such as the Stock Exchange of Thailand\nand the Cyprus Stock Exchange.) The ICB has 11 industries, 20 super sectors,\n45 sectors, and 173 subsectors.\nState Street Sector SPDRs, which stands for Standard & Poor’s depository\nreceipts, use the S&P 500 as the underlying index, which includes the 500 leading\ncompanies in the United States. They use a different classification system, the\nGlobal Industry Classification Standard (GICS), to determine the composition of\neach sector. This standard was developed jointly by Morgan Stanley Capital\nInternational (MSCI) and Standard & Poor’s (S&P). The GICS has 11 sectors,\n24 industry groups, 69 industries, and 158 subindustries.\nThe GICS takes a market-orientation approach. For example, it groups consumers\ninto two sectors, consumer discretionary and consumer staples, which both con-\ntain goods and services.

Consumer staples are considered noncyclical. Consumers have to buy\nthese products regardless of what’s happening in the economy. Consumer dis-\ncretionary is more impacted by cycles. As the economy expands and the average\nconsumer has more disposable income, they’re more likely to buy discretionary\nitems such as new clothes or a second car, for example.

This weighting assumes that all stocks have the same impact on the index.\nThis type of ETF outperforms a market-weighted ETF when small-cap stocks are\noutperforming large-cap stocks.

The utilities (XLU — Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund) and\nfinance (XLF — Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund) are sector funds to hold\nbecause the underlying stock prices tend to rise in the early part of a recession.\nInvestors tend to seek stocks that provide some safety and pay higher dividends.\nGold and other valuable mineral stocks also tend to look good when investors seek\nsafety. Although the 2008 recession was an anomaly, generally you see banks,\ninsurance companies, and investment firms perform well during the early parts of\na recession.\nFull recession\nYou may not think to look at consumer discretionary stocks when the economy is\nin a full recession, but during a full recession consumer expectations actually\nimprove. Spending begins to increase. Yet industrial productivity likely remains\nflat, and businesses don’t increase their production levels until they believe con-\nsumers are actually ready to spend again.",

You follow the same basic techniques we discuss in Chapters 15\nand 16. The only difference is that you use ETFs for building your trading system\nrather than stocks.\nETFs can be created from trading tools besides domestic stocks, such as com-\nmodities and currencies. If you’re more adventurous and understand the risks\ninvolved in other types of trading vehicles and strategies, you may want to check\nout some of the following ETFs.\nInternational trading with ETFs\nIf you want to add an international component to your trading strategy, ETFs\nmake that much easier. You don’t have to worry about the difficulties of research-\ning international stocks individually. You can just research the ETFs for the coun-\ntries you want to add to your strategy.\nBe careful, though, because now you’re adding in the market risks of international\ntrading, which include currency risks (the fluctuation of currency values among\nthe countries represented in the ETF) and political risks (the politics of every\ncountry whose stocks are in the ETF).\nCommodities and ETFs\nYou can also decide to add commodities to your trading mix. ETFs with commodi-\nties baskets or single commodities are available. But this type of trading is differ-\nent, so be sure to study the basics of commodity trading before you start risking\nyour money. If the topic interests you, pick up a copy of Commodities For Dummies,\nby Amine Bouchentouf (Wiley), before you get your feet wet.\nCurrency trading and ETFs\nYou can even trade currency using ETFs. Most major currencies have an ETF that\nyou can trade with a basket of assets in that currency. You can find out more\ninformation about currency trading in Currency Trading For Dummies, by Kathleen\nBrooks and Brian Dolan (Wiley).\nCHAPTER 14 Minimizing Trading Risks Using Exchange-Traded Funds 237",

For example, a 2:1 leverage fund means that every dollar invested\nby a trader in the fund is matched with a dollar of debt. Theoretically, if all goes\nwell, the leveraged ETF returns double. So if the index on which the leveraged ETF\nis based goes up 1 percent, the ETF’s value goes up by 2 percent.\nThat increase may sound great to you, but the opposite is also true. If the ETF makes\nthe wrong bet on the trend and the index goes down 1 percent, the ETF value goes\ndown by 2 percent. Leveraged ETFs definitely require a strategy for minimizing risks\nand make it instead a strategy that could compound the risks you take.\nInverse ETFs\nIf you want to hedge your bets and invest in an ETF that will move in the opposite\ndirection of the index, then choose an inverse ETF. This can provide a simpler\nalternative to traditional short selling. For example, the ProShares Short QQQ ETF\n(PSQ) is one to choose if you expect a downturn in the NASDAQ 100 Index.\nSo if you’re expecting the underlying index to go up but you want an insurance\npolicy in case the index goes down, you may choose to balance your trading port-\nfolio with an inverse ETF for the sector you’re betting on.\nActively Managed ETFs\nAnother fund type that you may come across in your research is the actively man-\naged ETF.",

Instead of sticking to a passive, predetermined investment strategy,\nactively managed ETFs have a manager and/or a team of analysts actively making\ndecisions about the portfolio. The fund may have a specific benchmark, sector, or\ntheme that the managers follow, but the team behind the actively managed ETF still\nhas the flexibility to direct the portfolio as they see fit. This can be a benefit by allow-\ning the managers to actively adapt to changing market conditions, but it can also be\na risk by introducing more human error into the investment process of the fund.\nA high-profile example of the actively managed ETF is the ARK Innovation ETF\n(ARKK), which is managed by Catherine Wood and her team at ARK Invest. The\nARK Innovation fund and other thematic actively managed ETFs from the ARK\nInvest group gained tremendous attention in 2020.

As long as you\nplace the trade while the market is open, you have some flexibility in the\nway your order is entered and executed. However, if you can’t monitor the\nmarket during business hours or if you enter your order after the market is closed,\nyou need to be much more precise when placing your order and indicating the type\nof fill (or terms of the order) you’re willing to accept. Otherwise, you may run into\na nasty surprise when you review your broker’s fill report and discover how the\ntrade was actually executed.\nThis chapter reviews available alternatives when you enter an order to buy, sell, or\nsell short and explains how the choices you make can affect the trade. We also\nreview margin requirements, discuss how trading affects your tax return, and\nidentify situations in which you must be aware of stock-trading regulations.\nEntering and Exiting Your Trade\nWhen you want to enter or exit a trade, you have to tell your broker what you want\nto do. To do that, you enter an order with your broker. This order tells the broker\nthe number of shares and the symbol for the stock, fund, or other security you\nplan to trade. Your order also specifies the type of transaction you’d like to execute\nand how you’d like the broker to handle your transaction. (See Chapter 2 for more\nCHAPTER 15 Executing Your Trades 239",

One of the most common is through trading with retail\ninvestors (that’s what market makers call you and us, the individual investors par-\nticipating in market trading activity). Market makers buy shares from a retail\ninvestor at one price and then turn around and sell those shares to another retail\ninvestor at a higher price. They buy at what is referred to as the bid price and then\nsell at what is referred to as the ask price. In addition to facilitating smooth market\ntrading activity, the goal of market makers is to sell for a price higher than they\nbuy, thus generating a profit.\nA market order tells your broker to buy or sell at the current market price. This\nmeans that if you use a market order when buying, your order is likely to be filled\nat the ask price. When selling, your market order is likely to be filled at the bid\nprice. Occasionally, your broker may be able to fill your order between the bid and\nask prices, but you should never count on it because it doesn’t happen very often.\nYour order can, however, become the highest bid or the lowest ask if you use a\nlimit order. A limit order allows you to set the price at which your trade is executed.\nYou specify the highest price you’re willing to pay when buying or the lowest price\nyou’re willing to accept when selling.

Also, the NYSE and NASDAQ each handle this order a little differently.\nYour broker can help you sort through the details if you encounter problems.\nUnderstanding the spread\nThe spread is the difference between the bid and ask prices. It is sometimes referred\nto as the inside spread, which is the difference between the highest bid and the low-\nest ask. Back when stock prices were quoted in increments of eighths (12.5 cents)\nand quarters (25 cents), the minimum spread was either an eighth or a quarter.\nToday, with decimal pricing, the spreads tend to be tighter and can be as low as a\npenny per share on the most actively traded stocks. Although the major exchanges\ndon’t support spreads less than one cent, some ECNs (electronic communications\nnetworks; see Chapter 2) permit tighter spreads for a small number of securities.\nWhen you place a limit order within the spread so that your limit price is between\nthe current bid and ask prices, your order will usually become either the best bid\nif you’re buying or the best ask if you’re selling. This approach makes sense\nwhenever the spread is particularly wide and the price isn’t moving very fast.\nWhen the spread is narrow, the way it is in Figure 15-1, using a market order is\nprobably best — that is, as long as the market is open and the stock is widely\ntraded.",

However, because you’re letting the market dictate your order’s fill price\nrather than specifying it yourself using a limit order, you run the risk of your trade\nexecuting at a price you didn’t expect, either much higher or much lower than\nyour target. Be aware of this concern and use market orders carefully, particularly\noutside of open market hours.\nThe biggest problem with trying to squeeze a profit out of the inside spread is that\nprices move. Keep in mind that stock quotes are only snapshots of current bid and\nask prices. By the time your order reaches the market, these quotes can (and do)\nchange. Even the fastest real-time quote systems lag a bit behind the real-time\nmarket prices trading on the exchanges, so it’s possible that the limit order you\njust entered between the spread is now outside the spread and won’t be filled —\nand believe us when we say that that can be disappointing.\nDevising an effective order-entry strategy\nDuring trading hours, you can be reasonably confident that a market order will be\nfilled at or near current market prices. But if you’re like most people, you don’t\nspend your day diligently tracking the market’s trading activity. As such, you need\nanother strategy for entering and exiting positions. You can use one or more of\nseveral alternative approaches to better control the terms and prices that you’re\nwilling to accept when your orders are filled.\n242 PART 4 Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks",

That means you can’t use market orders to enter your posi-\ntions. Instead, you can use limit orders, which enable you to set the highest price\nthat you’re willing to pay for a stock, making that your limit price. If you’re selling\nshort, choose the lowest price at which you’re willing to sell, and set that as your\nlimit price.\nLimit orders are effective for opening a position, but they can be problematic for\nexiting a position. For example, if you need to exit your position because the\nbreakout has failed (see Chapter 9), you simply need to exit the position without\ntrying to finesse the price. Failed trades recover infrequently, and they often get\nworse. You have no reason to be patient when things are going against you. In this\nsituation, the quick fill of a market order can be helpful.\nSimilarly, whenever you have a profitable trade and you’re trying to protect your\nprofits, a limit order rarely is your best choice for exiting the position. You’re bet-\nter off exiting the position by using either a market order or a stop order after\nyou’ve identified a reversal pattern.\nUsing stop orders and stop-limit\norders to enter a trade\nTraders normally talk about using stops for exiting or trading out of a position,\nbut stops are also effective for opening a position.",

If you identify the stock that\nyou want prior to an actual breakout, you can enter a buy stop at a price above the\nbreakout point. You can enter these orders on a GTC (good-’til-canceled) basis, so\nthat even if the trading range lasts a while, your order is poised to trigger a trans-\naction whenever the breakout occurs.\nMost brokers limit the length of time that orders can remain open, so make sure\nyou know your broker’s GTC policies and note that NASDAQ doesn’t have any pro-\nvisions for handling stop orders. If you’re trying to use stops when trading\nNASDAQ stocks, your broker has to provide the mechanism for triggering these\ntrades when your stop price is hit. Make sure that your broker can handle the stop\norders that you want to use.\nThe downside to this approach is obvious — you’re unable to confirm the break-\nout when using an automatic buy order. If the breakout fails and you’ve triggered\na buy order on the breakout, you now hold a position that’s losing money.\nAlthough we generally recommend waiting a few days to confirm the breakout,\nusing this strategy at times may be more appropriate than others.

However, you need to be much more\ntentative when the market is only in a bullish transition or pullback phase, or\nwhen you’re monitoring second and subsequent breakouts. When that’s the case,\nmake sure the breakout is confirmed — that means the stock remains above its\nbreakout price for a bullish breakout — after a few trading days before entering\nyour order. If you have any doubt, wait for confirmation.\nAnother problem with this approach is that after the stop price is reached, your\norder is triggered and it becomes a market order to buy or sell. You’re in the exact\nsituation you’d be in if you’d entered a market order while the market was closed.\nYou have no control over the fill price after your stop is triggered.\nFor example, say the stock price gaps higher (see Chapter 10) as it breaks out of its\ntrading range and surpasses your stop price by two or three dollars.

The only way to avoid this problem is\nby using a stop-limit order, which means when your stop price triggers the release\nof your order, the order becomes a limit order rather than a market order and is\nfilled only if the stock price pulls back below your limit price (see Chapter 2 for\nmore on limit and market orders). Again, be sure to confirm that your broker per-\nmits stop-limit orders on NASDAQ stocks.\nYou can also use a stop order or a stop-limit order to open a short position.

Stop-loss measures, and the rea-\nsons for them, are discussed more fully in Chapter 12.\nTiming your trades: Entering orders\nafter the market closes\nIn most cases, as long as you enter your trades during market hours, using a mar-\nket order is an acceptable strategy. However, if you plan to check your charts each\nevening and then enter your trades before heading to work in the morning, you\nmust use a different approach. Otherwise, you can suffer from opening price gaps\nand risk having your orders filled at prices that differ significantly from the previ-\nous closing prices.",

Otherwise, you can suffer from opening price gaps\nand risk having your orders filled at prices that differ significantly from the previ-\nous closing prices. To make matters worse, you may discover that your position is\nlosing money soon after being filled.\nDon’t be surprised to discover that many traders trade this way. Because of their\ndaily schedules, they analyze stock charts in the evening and enter orders before\nthe markets open. Unfortunately, common breakout and reversal patterns (see\nChapter 9) cause many traders to react in a predictable fashion. After they enter\nbuy orders for the same stock, a scarcity of that stock is likely to occur just after\nthe market opens. Scarcity causes prices of individual stocks to rise, sometimes\neven dramatically, so that all those after-market orders are filled at prices signifi-\ncantly higher than the previous closing price. Making matters worse, after the buy\norders are filled and buying pressure disappears, the stock price tumbles back\ntoward the previous closing price.\nProfessional traders — including floor traders, market makers, day traders, and\nswing traders — exacerbate the problem even further. These short-term traders\nsee the same technical signals on their charts that you notice on yours, and their\ngoal is to profit from your enthusiasm (and perhaps your inexperience) as you try\nto open your position.\nCHAPTER 15 Executing Your Trades 245",

When they see breakout or reversal patterns,\nshort-term traders anticipate a flurry of buying activity in that stock, and they\nknow that few people are going to be eager sellers when a stock breaks out of a\ntrading range. Under those circumstances, the only way buyers can get an\norder filled is if they bid the price higher or accept whatever price is being\nasked for the stock. When that happens, the best asking price is going to be\nrelatively high.\nSomeone will sell the stock to position traders but only at a relatively high asking\nprice. Short-term swing traders and day traders, who may not even own the stock,\noffer those asking prices, agreeing to provide the stock to the position traders as\nlong as the buying pressure pushes the stock’s price upward. If the short-term\ntraders don’t own the stock, they must sell the shares short; in other words, they\nmust borrow the stock before selling (see the later section “Selling Stocks Short”).\nAfter the short sellers absorb all that buying pressure, the rally fades, and the\nstock’s price falls back toward the breakout price. That’s when short-term traders\nbuy the stock (at prices lower than they sold it) so they can cover their short posi-\ntions, or in other words, return the shares that they borrowed to sell at higher\nprices to the position traders.",

How’s that for taking a quick profit!\nThis scenario is at the heart of why being patient usually makes sense. By steering\nclear of these environments of high buying pressure, you’re more likely to get a\nfar better fill. Plus, you can determine whether enough buying interest is truly\npresent to keep the stock price above the breakout price. Being patient doesn’t\nalways work, of course. Sometimes buying pressure drives the price higher, forc-\ning short sellers to cover at a loss, which, in turn, drives the price even higher.\nThis results in a runaway stock. When that does happen, you’ll probably be left\nstanding on the platform, watching the runaway stock as it leaves you behind.\nFortunately, runaway stocks don’t happen all that often. Thus, banking on runa-\nway stocks is a poor tactic.\nOur advice remains the same: Don’t chase these breakout and runaway stocks.\nWhen the cycle exhausts itself, as it ultimately must, the stock returns to a more\nrational price, and you can reevaluate whether your position continues to make\nsense.

This was one of the most vola-\ntile periods the stock market has seen since the Great Depression. Although the\nmarket in 2021–2022 will be another one to study in the future, looking back at\n2007–2009 gives us a better view to discuss at the time of this writing. To illus-\ntrate exactly what it takes not only to survive but also to succeed as a trader in\ntoday’s fast-paced market environment, let’s take a closer look at the week of\nDecember 8, 2008.\nBefore we begin, let’s recap the market’s performance prior to that week. The\nbroad market indexes peaked in October 2007. Stocks performed poorly over the\nnext year, but they accelerated sharply to the downside in September 2008.\nFrom its October 2007 intraday peak of 1,576 to its November 2008 low, the S&P\n500, like most broad-market indexes at that time, lost over 50 percent of its value.\nIn the months leading up to our sample week in December, the market saw several\nshort, sharp rallies mixed into this distinct downtrend.",

Rather than taking their word for it, we can use our analysis to see whether\nthe persistent downtrend had ended.\nThe technical indicators on the charts and fundamental economic conditions\nshowed a mixed picture for the first week of December 2008:\n» The economy was clearly still in recession, facing arguably some of the worst\neconomic conditions in our lifetime.\n» The Fed lowered the Fed funds rate to its lowest point ever, near 0 percent,\nintroducing relatively uncharted waters for the interest rate environment.\nCHAPTER 15 Executing Your Trades 247",

To sell a stock short, you bor-\nrow shares of a stock from your broker so you can sell them in the open market.\nYour broker gets those shares either from its own inventory or, more likely, from\nother clients. The proceeds of that sale go into your account. To close that posi-\ntion, you must buy the shares on the open market and return them to the broker.\nIf the price you pay for the stock, or the buy-to-cover price, is less than your selling\nprice, you earn a profit on the short sale. Conversely, if the buy-to-cover price is\nhigher, you suffer a loss.\nLet’s say you borrow 100 shares of Company X and sell the shares short for\n$100 per share. When the price drops to $80 per share, you buy the shares back\n(you can also say you covered the shorted shares) and return them to your broker.\nYou borrowed the shares, immediately sold them for $100 per share, and later\nbought them back for $80, netting a profit of $20 per share. It’s exactly the same\nprofit as if you had purchased the stock for $80 first and sold it for $100 later.\nConversely, say you borrow 100 shares of Company Y and sell them for $100 per\nshare. The stock price rises to $120 per share, and you decide to cover your loss.\nYou buy back the shares and pay $120 per share, but you sold them for $100 per\nshare.",

You have lost $20 per share on this trade.\nSome of the quirks unique to selling stocks short include the following:\n» Paying dividends to the lender: If the stocks pay a dividend during the\ntime a short seller holds a position, short sellers pay the dividends on the\nex-dividend date to the people who loaned them the stocks. Short sellers\nneed to keep the ex-dividend date in mind whenever shorting stocks.\n» Being forced to close a position: Whenever the original owner sells the\nstocks you borrowed, your broker can call away the shorted shares, which\nmeans your broker can force you to return the borrowed shares by buying\nthem on the open market at the current price. This happens rarely and\noccurs only when no shares are available for shorting.\n» Mandating the execution of short sales from only a margin account:\nShort sales must be executed in a margin account because your broker loans\nyou the stock to sell short and charges you interest on any margin balance in\nthe account.\n» Paying margin maintenance requirements: Your broker can force you\nto close a short position if you’re unable to satisfy maintenance margin\nrequirements.\nCHAPTER 15 Executing Your Trades 251",

Also, as we learned during the credit crisis,\nregulators can prohibit short selling on whole categories of stocks.\n» Limiting short selling to only stocks on an uptick: This uptick rule was\neliminated in July 2007, but a modified version was implemented again in\n2010. The essence of the old rule was that you couldn’t sell a stock short in a\nfalling market. Short sellers couldn’t easily pile into a falling stock. The 2010\nrule doesn’t apply to all securities. Today it’s triggered only when a security’s\nprice decreases by 10 percent or more from the previous day’s closing price.\nThe rule then stays in effect until the close of the next day.

Otherwise, you risk having severe restrictions\nplaced on your account.\nUnderstanding trade-settlement dates\nIn the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates\nwhen traders must settle their securities transactions.

For example, if your trade date is Monday, then the\ntrade settles Thursday, three business days after the trade date. Short sellers are\nsubject to the same settlement regulations as everybody else. That means the\nshort seller must deliver the borrowed shares to the buyer three business days\nfollowing the trade.\nMost securities, including broker-traded mutual funds and bonds, settle in this\nthree-day cycle. The shorthand for this settlement period is known as T + 3, which\nmeans trade date plus three days. Stock options and government securities, on the\nother hand, settle the day following the trade date, or T + 1.\nYour broker may insist that the money for all trades be available in your account\nbefore allowing you to execute any trades. Brokers can exercise this restriction\nbecause they’re permitted to set more stringent restrictions than regulations\nrequire. They can’t, however, set more lenient terms. Regardless of your broker’s\nrestrictions, the trade settles during the period specified by SEC regulations. One\nconsequence of this settlement cycle is that your broker is unlikely to allow you to\nwithdraw funds that are part of the trade until the trade settles.

Free riding occurs whenever you buy and sell a stock without depositing\nsufficient funds before settlement to pay for the transaction. For example, if you\nhave $5,000 in your cash account and you buy 1,000 shares of a $10 stock, for a\ntotal transaction cost of $10,000, you receive a money call to deposit $5,000 to\nsettle the trade. Of course, for the sake of simplicity, we ignored commission costs\nin this example.\nOne way that a trader may mistakenly violate the free-riding rules is trying to use\nthe same capital on two transactions in a single day. Here’s the scenario: Say you\nhave $10,000 of equity in your account and you buy 1,000 shares of a $10 stock.\nLater that same day, you’re stopped out of the position. So far there is no problem.\nBut if you try to reenter the position on the same day, then you receive a money\ncall for the full price of the second trade. The bottom line: You can’t use the same\ncapital to open two positions on the same day in a cash account. That’s free riding.\nNote, however, that these trades are permitted in a margin account. Trading in a\nmargin account means you’re not at risk of violating free-riding regulations.\nCHAPTER 15 Executing Your Trades 253",

When you’re\nrestricted, you must have enough funds in your account to cover your trade before\nthe broker executes your order. Restrictions usually are imposed for 90 days.\nAvoiding margin calls and forced sales\nAlthough trading on margin is very powerful, it’s also potentially very risky. You\nmay recall from our discussion about differing types of accounts in Chapter 2 that\na margin account enables you to borrow money from your broker, which, in turn,\npermits you to leverage your trading capital. This leverage can improve your total\nreturn when things go well, but it can also amplify any losses when a trade goes\nagainst you. A margin account is required if you plan to sell stock short.\nBefore putting your margin to work, you must become familiar with the rules\ngoverning its use. The Federal Reserve determines the maximum amount that\nyour broker can loan you. Currently, the Fed permits your broker to loan you up\nto 50 percent of the value of each trade. The Fed hasn’t changed the margin\nrequirement values since 1974. Prior to 1974, however, the Fed had adjusted\nmargin requirements 22 times to limit stock market speculation and inflationary\npressures.\nUnderstanding margin fees\nYour broker charges interest on the average daily margin balance, regardless of\nwhether it’s held as cash or stocks.",

The margin balance is an adjustable rate loan\nfor which the interest rate is based on the current broker call rate, which sometimes\nis known as the money call rate. Brokers usually quote their respective margin rates\nas the broker call rate plus a percentage, where the added amount depends on the\nsize of your loan. You can find the current broker call rate online with a quick\nGoogle search.\nUnderstanding margin collateral\nYour trading positions represent the collateral used to secure your margin loan.\nBrokers require the value of your collateral to be sufficient to cover any outstand-\ning loan. The amount required by your broker, called the minimum maintenance\nmargin, can range from 25 percent upward. In other words, your broker requires\nthe equity in your account to be at least 25 percent of the market value of your\nmargined stocks.\nIf the equity value of your account falls below the minimum maintenance margin,\nyou receive a margin call, a demand from your broker to deposit more money in\nyour account.

Falling stock prices mean falling\nequity values.\nAs an example, say that you have $10,000 in your account and you buy 1,000\nshares of a $20 stock, which is $20,000 worth of stock. Current margin regula-\ntions require that you maintain a deposit of at least 50 percent of the value of that\ntrade in your account to open that trade and 25 percent of the total value of the\nposition to maintain it. After purchasing the stock, your account has $10,000 of\nequity and $10,000 in a margin loan. A margin call occurs in our example when\nthe price of the stock falls dramatically the next day from $20 to $12, representing\na loss of 40 percent. At this point, you still owe the $10,000 margin loan to your\nbroker, but the total equity in your account now is only $2,000. The 25 percent\nminimum maintenance requirement is $3,000 (that’s 25 percent of $12,000, or\n1,000 shares at $12 each), so you’d receive a maintenance margin call to deposit\n$1,000 to bring your account up to the $3,000 minimum equity amount.\nNotice in the example that you’re also dangerously close to owing more to your\nbroker than the stock is worth. If the stock’s price falls much further, the broker\nlikely will liquidate your position to satisfy your outstanding loan. Brokers are\nallowed to liquidate your position at any time without your explicit approval.",

Brokers are\nallowed to liquidate your position at any time without your explicit approval. In\nfact, they’re allowed to liquidate any position in your account to satisfy your loan.\nThis example illustrates the risks of using margin. The value of the stock fell\n40 percent in the example, but you lost 80 percent of your equity. Another small\ndrop down to a 50 percent loss in the stock will result in a complete 100 percent\nloss for you. Always remember that leverage cuts both ways. Earning double the\nprofits may be nice, but doubling your losses is immensely painful. Our recom-\nmendation is to never satisfy a margin call — close the offending position\ninstead. In our example, you should have set stops so you’d be able to get out of\nthe losing position long before you got the margin call. But after that margin call\nis generated, you need to liquidate the losing position(s) immediately to pay off\nthe margin loan.\nWhen you open a margin account, you must sign a hypothecation agreement, a\nbinding agreement that explicitly entitles your broker to liquidate positions to\nsatisfy outstanding margin loans. The hypothecation agreement also permits your\nbroker to loan any stock in your margin account to another client to provide shares\nfor that client to short the stock. When you short a stock, the shares of the stock\nthat you sell must come from somewhere, and that somewhere is most often from\nother clients who own the stock. If you’re the one shorting stock, one “gotcha”\ncan accompany this scenario. If the stock you borrowed is sold to someone else,\nthen your broker can call away your short position in a forced sale. Although\nforced sales like this don’t happen very often, they are nevertheless a risk that you\nmust fully understand and be ready to assume if you short stock.\nCHAPTER 15 Executing Your Trades 255",

A day trade is defined as entering and exiting a single position in the\nsame day. You can buy a stock and sell it or you can short a stock and cover the\nposition. Either way, if both transactions occur on the same day, it’s considered a\nday trade. If you day trade four or more times within a five-business-day period,\nyou’re classified as a pattern day trader unless your day trades represent fewer than\n6 percent of the total number of trades executed during the same period, which is\na huge threshold. After you’re classified as a pattern day trader, your account\nmust have at least $25,000 of equity before you’re permitted to execute additional\nday trades. Day trading margin rules are discussed in Chapter 18.\nThe Tax Man Cometh\nTrading profits are taxable and are usually taxed as income at the trader’s mar-\nginal income tax rate. Traders rarely hold positions long enough to qualify for the\nspecial (typically much lower) capital gains treatment available to long-term\ninvestors. Still, paying taxes is better than losing profits or principal.\nOne tax trap that snares traders is the wash sale rule. Normally, you can deduct\ntrading losses from trading gains before calculating your income tax burden.\nHowever, if you sell a stock for a loss and then repurchase the stock within\n30 days, you can’t deduct the trading loss. Fortunately, the loss isn’t lost for-\never. You can use it to adjust the cost basis on the trade by the amount of the\nloss, which ultimately reduces the amount of tax owed when the position is\nfinally closed. This adjustment effectively raises the cost of a stock purchase, for\ntax purposes, so you owe less tax. A similar adjustment is available when\nselling short.\nDay traders receive special tax treatment, but you must be a bona fide day trader\nto qualify. The details are reviewed in Chapter 18.\n256 PART 4 Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks",

Trading systems often are\nbuilt using common indicators, oscillators, and moving averages (see\nChapter 11). You can combine these various technical analysis tools to create a vir-\ntually unlimited number of trading systems. For the novice trader, the advantage\nto this approach is that you don’t need to invent something new to create and\npersonalize an effective system.\nThe downside, however, is equally obvious. Many traders use these common tools\nand end up with a system that offers little competitive advantage and only modest\n(if any) profits. In addition, these systems can be difficult to use because the sig-\nnals of one trading system mirror the signals of many others, which makes enter-\ning and exiting positions troublesome.\nUltimately, you want to develop or adapt a trading system that closely fits your\npersonality, trading time frame, schedule, and trading objectives. This chapter\nhelps you methodically develop and add to a trading approach that uses your own\npersonalized repertoire of trading systems. It also helps you recognize and avoid\ndestructive and costly habits that can sabotage your trading efforts. In addition,\nCHAPTER 16 Developing Your Own Powerful Trading System 257",

The\nfirst characteristic has to do with the two ways a trader interacts with the system.\nIn this case, trading systems are either\n» Discretionary trading systems: A system that presents trading candidates\nfor your consideration but leaves the final trade execution decision to you.\n» Mechanical trading systems: A computer-based system that automatically\ngenerates buy and sell signals that will always be traded.\nThe other way to categorize a trading system is by how it treats trends in the\nmarkets. In this case, trading systems are either\n» Trend-following trading systems: A system that tries to identify trade entry\nand exit points for new or existing trends.\n» Countertrend trading systems: A system that tries to identify trade entry\nand exit points by finding tops and bottoms.\nAlthough these categorizations are not mutually exclusive of each other (mechan-\nical and discretionary systems, for example, can both be trend-following sys-\ntems), each approach has its fair share of both champions and detractors, so we\ndiscuss the strengths and weaknesses of each type of system in the sections that\nfollow.",

Unfortunately, the popularity of the trend-\nfollowing approach is one of its greatest weaknesses. Too many of these systems\ngenerate very similar buy and sell signals, which, in turn, makes outperforming\nthe average trader difficult for any individual trend-following trader.\nEven the best trend-following systems have a relatively large percentage of failed\ntrades, primarily because they depend on several extremely profitable trades to\nmake up for the large percentage of losing trades. If your trend-following system\nis also a discretionary system, your discretion (or lack of it) can cause you to miss\na few of these profitable trades. In this case, your overall results will suffer.\nTrend-following systems are typically based on either moving averages or break-\nout patterns (see Chapters 9 and 11). Moving average–based trading systems are\nthe most popular and can be quite profitable; however, they work only when a\nstock is trending. These trading systems depend on long-lasting trends to gener-\nate enough profit to outweigh a relatively large number of losing trades. In fact,\nthe number of losing trades can easily outnumber the winning trades with this\ntype of trading system. When a stock is range bound (stuck moving sideways\nwithin a specific price range), a moving average–based system generates a large\nnumber of losing trades. Because of the high overall number of trades, this system\nis often accompanied by relatively high transaction and slippage costs (see the\nlater section “Accounting for slippage”). Smart money management protocols are\ncritical when using a trend-following trading system.\n260 PART 4 Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks",

For example, you can insist that its trading signals be confirmed\nby another condition before actually entering any positions. If your system trig-\ngers a buy signal, for example, you may want to see whether the signal remains in\neffect for at least a day or two before entering a position. We show some examples\nof moving-average and breakout systems, along with some ideas to improve the\nperformance of these systems, in the section “Developing and Testing Trading\nSystems,” later in this chapter.\nCountertrend systems\nFor many traders, the quest to find a profitable countertrend trading system is all\nconsuming. Countertrend systems appear desirable because their goal is to buy low\nand sell high. These systems try to identify inflection points, or the moments when\nstocks change direction, so traders can take positions close to when they occur.\nThis approach may work in a few narrowly defined situations, such as in a trading\nrange (Chapter 9) or a trend channel (Chapter 10), but it’s likely to fail in a spec-\ntacular and expensive way if attempted on a broader scale.\nThe vast majority of trading systems follow market trends. This is simply a\nhigher-probability practice. Trend-following systems tend to outperform coun-\ntertrend systems, especially for position traders. Swing traders and some day\ntraders sometimes use a countertrend approach, but even then, they usually do so\nin conjunction with a trend-following component.",

Countertrend systems generate a large volume\nof trades, and the more you trade, the more you spend on transaction and slippage\ncosts. These costs alone often swamp potentially profitable systems.

Many new traders begin system testing by combining a few\noff-the-shelf indicators in an effort to obtain better trading results. Doing so is as\ngood a place as any to begin.\nHowever, we want to caution you to keep your systems simple enough that you\ncan understand not only the system but also the result. Simplicity usually is better\nwhen trading, especially when you’re first becoming familiar with the processes\nof system development and testing. We describe the process by looking at a couple\nof examples in the sections that follow.\nWorking with trend-following systems\nMany trend-following systems use a moving average for their starting points. In\nthis trend-following example, the system is designed for position trading, which\nmeans you use a relatively long moving average. Short selling isn’t permitted with\nthis simple system.\nThe first step is to define buy and sell rules for your initial testing. The actual code\nfor defining these rules depends on your specific system-development package.\nCHAPTER 16 Developing Your Own Powerful Trading System 265",

The rules for an\ninitial test may look like this:\n» Buy at tomorrow’s opening price when today’s price crosses and closes above\nthe 50-day exponential moving average (EMA).\n» Sell at tomorrow’s opening price when today’s price crosses and closes below\nthe 50-day EMA.\nTo test whether using a moving average as a starting point is a good idea in a\ntrend-following system, apply these two rules to ten years of historical data for the\nstocks of your choice. After testing this idea, you find that this simple system works\nfairly well when stock prices are trending, but it’s likely to trigger many losing\ntrades when the prices of stocks are range bound. You can try to avoid these losing\ntrades, and possibly improve your overall trading results, by filtering out trading-\nrange situations. One way to accomplish that goal is by changing the buy rule to\nread as follows: Buy at tomorrow’s open when the following conditions are true:\n» Today’s closing price is above the 50-day EMA.\n» The stock crossed above the 50-day EMA sometime during the last 5 days.\n» Today’s 50-day EMA is greater than the 50-day EMA from 5 days ago.\nThese added conditions serve as signal confirmation. When you test these rules,\nyou find they reduce the number of whipsaw trades for most stocks, but they’re\nalso likely to delay buy and sell signals on profitable trades and thus usually result\nin smaller profits on those trades.",

However, this adjustment makes the overall\nsystem more profitable because the number of losses is reduced.\nYou can find out whether other changes that you can make in your simple system\ncan actually improve profitability. You may, for example, test different types of\nmoving averages. Try, for example, a simple moving average (SMA) rather than an\nexponential moving average (EMA). Or you may want to try using different time\nframes for your moving average, such as 9-day, 25-day, or 100-day moving aver-\nages. See Chapter 11 for more details about the multiple types of moving averages.\nIdentifying system-optimization pitfalls\nMost system-development and testing software comes equipped with a provision\nfor system optimization, which allows you to fine-tune the technical analysis\ntools used in your trading system. You can, for example, tell the system to find the\ntime frame of the moving average that produces the highest profit for one stock\nand then ask it to do the same thing for a different stock. Some systems enable you\nto test this factor simultaneously for many stocks.\n266 PART 4 Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks",

If you\nfind, for example, that a 22-day moving average works best for one stock, a\n37-day moving average works best for the next stock, and another stock performs\nbest using a 74-day moving average, you’re going to run into problems. The set of\ncircumstances leading to these optimized results won’t likely repeat in precisely\nthe same way again in the future. We can almost guarantee that whatever opti-\nmized parameters you may find for these moving averages won’t be the optimal\nchoices when trading real capital.\nThis is a simple example of a problem that’s well known to scientists and econo-\nmists who build mathematic models to forecast future events. It’s called curve\nfitting because you’re molding your model to fit the historical data. You can expend\nquite a bit of effort fine-tuning a system to identify all the major trends and turn-\ning points in historical data for a particular stock, but that effort isn’t likely to\nresult in future trading profits. In that case, your optimized system is more likely\nto cause a long string of losses rather than profits.\nTesting a long moving average and comparing the results to a short moving aver-\nage is fine, and so is testing a few points in between a long moving average and a\nshort moving average. As long as you use this exercise to understand why short\nmoving averages work best for short-term trades and why longer moving aver-\nages work better for traders with longer trading horizons, you’ll be fine.",

Other-\nwise, you’re probably moving into the realm of curve fitting and becoming\nfrustrated with your actual trading results.\nTesting with blind simulation\nBlind simulation is a method for setting aside enough historical data so you can test\nyour system-optimization results and avoid the problem of curve fitting. For\nexample, you may test data from 1990 through 1999 and thus exclude data from\n2000 through the present. After you’ve developed a system that looks good enough\nfor you to base your trades on, you can then test your system against the data that\nwas excluded. If the system performs as well with the excluded data as it did with\nthe original test data, you may have a system worth trading. If it fails, you obvi-\nously need to rethink your system.\nAnother approach is choosing your historical data with extreme care. You can\nexpect trend-following systems like a moving-average system to perform well\nduring long, powerful trends. If your stock had a strong run up during the long-\nlasting 1990s bull market, that kind of price data can skew your results, magically\nmaking any trend-following system appear profitable. Whether that success\nactually can be duplicated during a subsequent bull market, however, must first be\nthoroughly tested.\nCHAPTER 16 Developing Your Own Powerful Trading System 267",

You may want to address this problem by excluding periods from your test\ndata when your stock was doing exceptionally well or when the results of any\ntrades were significantly more profitable than the average trade. This technique is\na valid approach to eliminating the extraordinary results arising from extraordi-\nnary situations in your historical data. Using it should give you a better idea of\nyour system’s potential for generating real profits in the future.\nUsing breakout trading systems\nSimilar to moving average–based systems, a breakout system can take many forms.\nYou may already be familiar with the trading-range breakout system we describe\nin Chapter 9. To test a different approach, you can define a breakout system as\nfollows:\n» Buying at tomorrow’s opening price when today’s closing price is above the\nhighest high price that occurred during the last 20 days\n» Selling at tomorrow’s opening price when today’s closing price is below the\nlowest low that occurred over the last 20 days\nThese trading rules are loosely based on the rules for Donchian channels (some-\ntimes called price channels), which comprise a breakout system developed by\nRichard Donchian in the 1950s. Donchian was one of the early developers of trend-\nfollowing trading systems.\nA spreadsheet may be helpful for evaluating this system.",

You also can use the spread-\nsheet to dig into the system’s results to find out what works and what doesn’t.\nFigure 16-1 shows an example.\nRe-creating the spreadsheet in Figure 16-1 is straightforward. After downloading\nthe historical price data into a spreadsheet format, all you have to do is encode the\nformulas into the correct columns. The formulas are described in the nearby side-\nbar “Creating the Donchian channel spreadsheet.”\nIf you’re like most traders, the first thing you’ll do is calculate some statistics\nabout the system.

In the case of the Donchian channel breakout system, initial results\ndon’t look promising. The system lost money during the entire test period.\nIf you’re like most traders, your impulse is to discard the idea and move on to\nanother. But with the Donchian channel breakout system, you need to dig a little\nfurther before you do. During the time frame of this test, the system triggered\n30 trades, 18 of which were losing trades. However, 13 of those losing trades were\nprofitable at some point during the process, and all the winning trades gave back\na large part of the profits before the sell signal was triggered. In fact, many of the\nprofitable trades gave back significantly more than half of the profits before the\nsell signal.\nFigure 16-1 shows how a single position from the spreadsheet progressed. The\nentry trade was triggered when the price of QQQQ closed above the September 4\nDonchian high. In this simulated trade, the stock was purchased at the September\n5 opening price of $49.56 and then sold on November 9, the day after the price of\nQQQQ closed below the November 8 Donchian low.\nIf you look through the last three columns, you’ll notice that this simulated trade\nwas profitable but closed well below its most profitable price.",

If that happens once\nduring simulated trading, you may not need to worry much about it, but if it\noccurs frequently, you need to think of ways to remedy the problem.\nIn the Donchian channels system, buy signals apparently work better than sell\nsignals. Therefore, you need to consider different types of stops and sell signals.\nOne simple idea that’s worth testing is stopping out (selling at a predetermined\nprice) of a position if the stock’s low (instead of its close) falls below the Donchian\nlow. Another is to shorten the time frame for the exit signal by using a five- or\nten-day Donchian channel. Or you can, for example, use a trailing stop or some\ncompletely different criteria to exit these positions.\nIn any case, this example gives you ideas about how you can use a spreadsheet to\ntest and analyze any trading system. It also provides you with some suggestions\nabout how you can use this kind of analysis to improve your system’s results.\nAccounting for slippage\nSlippage is the term traders use to describe the costs of trading, which is made up\nof two components. The first is the actual transaction or commission cost for\nexecuting your trade. The second is more difficult to measure because it’s the sum\nof the costs of unfavorable fills. If, for example, you’re planning to buy at tomor-\nrow’s opening price based on today’s closing price, those two prices can be very\ndifferent. An unfavorable fill is a cost of trading and accounted for as slippage.\n270 PART 4 Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks",

(These first 20 rows are not shown in Figure 16-1.) The following calcula-\ntions assume that column headers are in the first row, and the price data begins in the\nsecond row.

After entering a formula in\nthe following columns, copy the formula for that column to every row that has price\ndata.\nThe remaining columns are configured as follows:\n• Column F is the upper Donchian channel. Use the spreadsheet MAX function to find\nthe highest price value for the previous 20 trading days. Start this calculation in Row\n22, giving 20 rows of data. The calculation for Row 22, Column F, is =MAX(C2:C21).\nNotice that the formula doesn’t include the current row.

The calculation for Row 22, column F, is =MIN(D2:D21).\nAs for the upper Donchian channel, the formula doesn’t include the current row.\n• Column H is the change flag indicator.

It occupies the middle ground between position\ntrading and day trading. Swing traders use trend-following and counter-\ntrend strategies to participate in trading-range and trending stocks. This turbo-\ncharged trading style requires an exceptional understanding of the inner workings\nof the markets and excellent analysis capabilities.\nIn this chapter, we discuss a few of the basic techniques used by swing traders\nalong with the risks unique to the discipline. We also talk about tax issues and\naccount restrictions unique to swing trading.\nSelecting Stocks Carefully\nSwing trading is a technical discipline. Although no hard-and-fast rule defines it,\nswing traders often trade in 100-share increments and usually limit the number\nof simultaneous positions to ten or fewer. A swing trade can last as little as a few\nhours to as long as a few weeks, but typical swing trades span no more than a few\ndays. On this kind of timescale, fundamental analysis has little impact on a stock’s\nCHAPTER 17 The Basics of Swing Trading 279",

Careful trade management is crucial to swing-trading success.\nStock selection is even more important for swing trading than it is for position\ntrading. When you’re looking for a stock to move right away, you base your deci-\nsions on selection criteria different from when you’re positioning for a move that\nmay last several weeks to several months. Following are a few of the important\nselection criteria that swing traders use:\n» Volume and liquidity: Swing traders typically focus on actively traded and\nrelatively large stocks. The goal is finding stocks that are easy to buy, sell, and\nsell short. When trading time frames are short, you need to be able to execute\nyour orders quickly. Unfortunately, stocks with the greatest liquidity and\ntrading volumes are closely followed by the largest number of professional\ntraders, which usually constrains the number of profitable swing-trading\nopportunities, so swing traders often scout opportunities outside of the\n25 or so stocks that have the highest trading volume and greatest liquidity.\n» Trending: Trending stocks provide the best opportunity for swing-trading\nprofits. You may use either the methods described in Chapter 9 for identifying\ntrending stocks or the average directional index (ADX) indicator.",

You may use either the methods described in Chapter 9 for identifying\ntrending stocks or the average directional index (ADX) indicator. This indicator\nhas three components: the ADX reading and two directional movement\nindicators — the +DMI and the –DMI. An ADX reading of more than 30 or so\nindicates a trending stock. A comparison of the two DMIs shows you whether\nthe ADX is trending up or down. If the value of +DMI is larger than the value\nof –DMI, then the stock is trending higher. If the value of –DMI is larger than\nthe value of +DMI, the stock is trending lower. The ADX indicator is included\nin most charting applications.\n» Volatility: Swing traders depend on larger, or more volatile, short-term\nmoves for profits. As a result, they want to trade stocks that have histories of\nmaking large moves in short periods of time. One popular approach to finding\nthem is keeping an eye on the average daily ranges (ADRs), which are simple\nmoving averages that track the day-to-day differences between an individual\nstock’s daily high and low prices. If you’re swing trading, you want stocks that\nshow high ADRs. Volatility also can be measured using historic volatility, which\nwe discuss in the later “Trading volatility” section.\n» Sector selection: Just like position trading, swing traders try to trade stocks\nin the strongest sectors, and the weakest sectors are candidates for short\nsales. Use the techniques described in Chapter 13 to identify strong and\nweak sectors.\n» Tight spreads: As a means of controlling slippage (see Chapter 16), you need\nto pay close attention to the difference between the bid and ask prices of the\nstocks you’re considering as swing-trading prospects.

Low-priced stocks rarely are\ngood candidates for swing trading because the spread, as a percentage of the\nstock price, is usually too wide.\nLooking at Swing-Trading Strategies\nSwing trading fluctuates between the use of trend-following and countertrend\nstrategies:\n» When a stock is trending strongly, swing traders primarily employ trend-\nfollowing techniques but may use countertrend techniques to fine-tune\nexit points.\n» When a stock is range bound, swing traders use countertrend methods to\nidentify entry and exit points.\nTrading trending stocks\nTechnical-analysis patterns that we cover in Chapters 9 through 13 are all appli-\ncable to swing trading. Patterns repeat in all time frames; the difference is in how\nswing traders use and interpret these common patterns. Trend-following strate-\ngies are more aggressive for swing trading than they are for position trading.\nAlthough swing traders use some of the same indicators and patterns used by\nposition traders, they often use them in different ways. We explain a few examples\nin the sections that follow.\nTrading pullbacks\nA pullback is another name for a consolidation within a trend. Consolidation pat-\nterns include the flags and pennants discussed in Chapter 10. Swing traders use\ndaily charts and intraday charts — ranging from 1-minute bars to 60-minute bar\ncharts — to identify the dominant short-term trend and any pullback patterns\nwithin the trend. They try to enter a position when the price of a targeted stock\nstops declining or pulling back so they can capture the next move higher in the\ntrend. Conceptually, pullback trading is simple, but in practice, it’s trickier than it\nsounds.\nAfter you identify a trending stock and find a flag or pennant pullback pattern by\nvisually examining the daily charts, you must try to enter a position just as the\npullback is ending.

A buy\nstop is like any stop order; when the price is hit, the order is executed. (See\nChapter 12 for details.) Entering a position to trade pullbacks is an iterative pro-\ncess, so we recommend using a day order rather than a good-’til-canceled order\n(see Chapter 15). Here are the steps:\n1.\nSelect your buy stop price so it’s just above the intraday high price shown\nin the last bar of the chart.\n2.\nIf the stock price trades above your buy stop price, your order is\nexecuted.\nOtherwise, the order is canceled at the end of the day.\n3.\nAs long as you’re still interested in this trade, adjust your buy stop price\nto just above the intraday high of the most recent bar on the chart and\nreenter your order.\n4.\nAfter your order is filled, place a stop-loss order (see Chapter 12) using a\nstop price just below the intraday low of the lowest bar in the pullback\non the chart.\n5.\nAs long as the trade is active, continue adjusting the stop price to be just\nbelow the intraday low of the most recent bar on the chart.\nFigure 17-2 is a price chart of the stock of National Oilwell Varco, Inc.

You\nhad set the buy price just above the January 29 high, which was $29.44. NOV\nopened January 30 at $28.90. The trade was triggered when the stock climbed\nabove $29.45, rising as high as $30.01 before backing off to close at $29.80. You\ncould expect your order to fill very near your $29.45 buy stop price. For the sake\nof our example, we assume a fill price of $29.50.\nImmediately following the trade execution, you set a stop-loss order below\nthe low of the previous bar, $28.74 in this case.

The trade was trig-\ngered on February 21, shown as Bar #5, when NOV traded above the February 20\nhigh of $33.85.

Practice finding good swing trades by working with historical charts and\nlook for trends similar to the ones noted earlier.\nSwing trades don’t always work out, of course. Complications and frequent losing\ntrades always are possible.\nSurfing channels\nAnother trend-following approach to swing trading uses a channeling strategy to\nidentify entry and exit points. Chapter 10 explains the channeling strategy and\nhow to construct the channel lines. After you identify a channel on the daily\ncharts, you treat channel lines as lines of support and resistance. Figure 17-3\nshows an example.\nFIGURE 17-3:\nA chart of\nConocoPhillips\n(COP), in a\ntrend channel.\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\nAfter identifying support and resistance levels for a channeling stock, you can\nmonitor its chart for reversals near the channel lines.

As a stock price falls toward\nits lower channel or support level, begin watching intraday charts for indications\nthat the stock is changing direction and heading higher. If you see an intraday low\nnear the location of the support channel line, followed by a higher high and a\nhigher low, you can use that situation as an entry signal. After entering a long\nposition, you place a stop-loss order just below the support channel line.\nYou hold this long position until either it stops out or the stock approaches its\nupper channel-resistance level. Again, you need to monitor the intraday charts for\nhints of a change in direction and exit the trade whenever you see the reversal.\nAfter that, you wait for the stock to head back toward the lower channel line to\ninitiate a new long trade.\nTrading range-bound stocks\nUnlike the typical position trader, a swing trader is more likely to use counter-\ntrend strategies (see Chapter 16) and actively participate when a stock is range\nbound. The swing trader tries to make trades based on price movements from the\nbottom to the top of the range and back down again. You can use either daily or\nweekly charts to identify the trading range. An example using a daily chart is\nshown in Figure 17-4.\nFIGURE 17-4:\nA chart of\nGenzyme General\n(GENZ) shows\nstock prices\nbounding within\na trading range.\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\nCHAPTER 17 The Basics of Swing Trading 285",

You can use a few\napproaches to enter a position.\nYou can, for example, simply choose to place a buy order using a limit price just\nabove the support line. Another approach that may give you a little more control\nand provide better entry and exit points is to monitor the stock to find pivot points\nas it trades near the support line. A pivot point is a three-bar pattern in which the\nlow price of the middle bar is lower than the lows of the bars on either side of it.\nThe entry and exit points for this kind of trading are similar to the ones used for\ntrading based on a pullback pattern.

To\nfind these stocks, swing traders spend a great deal of effort measuring and ana-\nlyzing volatility, usually in the form of historic volatility. Although the math\nrequired to calculate historic volatility is complex, the concept is simple. Historic\nvolatility measures a stock’s price movement. The faster it moves, the higher the\nhistoric volatility. Fortunately, many charting and analysis programs include a\nmethod for calculating historic volatility, so you don’t have to program in the\nformula.\n286 PART 5 Risk-Taker’s Paradise",

The term itself probably originated with W. D. Gann when he invented the\nswing chart during the 1920s. George Douglass Taylor popularized the phrase, and\na short-term trading technique, when he introduced a now classic three-bar trading\npattern in his 1950 book, The Taylor Trading Technique.\nTaylor’s ideas serve as the basis for much of today’s swing-trading methodology.\nAccording to Taylor, trending stocks tend to rally, rest, and then continue to trend.\nSwing traders watch for these rest periods and attempt to enter the market just in\nadvance of the thrust of the new trend.\nTaylor’s method, sometimes called the book trader’s method, was originally developed\nto trade futures contracts in the grain markets. Taylor theorized that the market cycles\nthrough three distinct phases or days. The first phase is the buy day, the second is a sell\nday, and the third is a sell-short day. Although these three days don’t necessarily fall on\nconsecutive days, for the sake of following the discussion, we assume they do.\nTaylor first determines the short-term trend, finds the position of the short-term cycle\nwithin the trend, and then uses this information to determine when to buy, sell, or sell\nshort. The buy day begins the cycle.",

The buy day begins the cycle. A typical buy day begins with weakness, and the\ntrader takes a long position near a previously identified support level based on the\nweakness. This position is held overnight into the next day, the sell day. The sell day\ntypically opens strong, but the strength fades before the close. The trader sells at\nthe early signs of weakness. The final day of the cycle is the sell-short day. The trader\nwatches for any strength near resistance levels on the third day and sells short into this\nstrength. The short position is held overnight and then covered during early weakness\nthe following buy day. The cycle begins in earnest again with the trader initiating a long\nposition after covering the short position.\nTaylor’s approach is difficult to execute. Like all swing trading, it requires constant moni-\ntoring of the market and an excellent understanding of support and resistance levels. It\nis a discretionary approach that is difficult to test. Few stocks actually follow a three-day\nscript on consecutive days. Many stocks trend for several days before pulling back or\nrising, so the three-bar method must be adjusted to account for these differences.\nNevertheless, Taylor’s thinking is evident in much of today’s swing-trading methodology.\nHistoric volatility isn’t concerned with the direction of a stock’s price movement.\nA high historic volatility value doesn’t reveal whether a stock’s price is rising or\nfalling. Although swing traders want to know that a stock trends in one direction\nor the other, they don’t really care which direction. Downside movement is just as\nattractive as upside movement to the swing trader.\nCHAPTER 17 The Basics of Swing Trading 287",

One\npopular approach uses historic volatility for finding stocks that have been very\nvolatile but currently are experiencing quiet periods. These temporarily quiet\nstocks often return to previous levels of historic volatility, and that presents a\nswing-trading opportunity. Swing traders identify these stocks by comparing\nmeasurements of historic volatility across longer and much shorter periods of\ntime and expressing that comparison as a ratio. The ratio looks like this:\nHistoric volatility ratio Short-term historic volatility\nLLong-term historic volatility\nOne common ratio compares a 6-day historic volatility with a 100-day historic\nvolatility. Whenever the value of that ratio is less than 50 percent, the stock is a\ncandidate for a swing-trading position.\nAfter this stock takes a short low-volatility rest, it is likely to return to its historic\nlevel of volatility with a fast move. Remember that volatility tells you nothing\nabout the direction of price movements, so to get around this limitation, be sure\nto place buy and sell-short stop orders, respectively, above the high and below the\nlow of the current bar.",

Using the first approach, the stock may take\noff in one direction and quickly reverse course, and you may end up holding a\nposition with a highly volatile stock heading the wrong way. This same scenario\nalso can happen with the second approach. Another potential problem occurs\nwhen the stock price gaps through your entry order because your order may end\nup getting filled at a price significantly different from what you expected.\nMoney management issues\nBecause of the short duration of each trade, swing trading generates a large\nvolume of trades. Execution and slippage costs (see Chapter 12) can be very high.\nProfits are relatively small when measured on each trade, so losses must be\ncarefully controlled.\nYou need to adhere closely to the money management rules we discuss in\nChapter 12. In addition, each swing trade must represent only a small percentage\nof your trading capital. Ten percent of your capital per trade is too much.

When profit potential is small, don’t take\nbig risks, or you won’t be a swing trader for long.\nUsing Options for Swing Trading\nStock options can be used as substitutes for the underlying stocks when swing\ntrading. A stock option is a limited-duration contract that grants the option buyer\nthe right to either buy or sell a stock for a fixed price. The option seller, usually\ncalled the option writer or the option grantor, is granting the right to the option\nbuyer to either buy or sell a specific stock for a fixed price.\nEach option represents 100 shares of stock. A call is an option to buy 100 shares\nof a specified stock. The call buyer is acquiring a limited-duration right to buy\n100 shares of a stock from the option grantor at a fixed price, called the strike price.\nA put is an option to sell 100 shares of a specified stock. The put buyer is acquiring\na limited-duration right to sell 100 shares of a stock to the option grantor at the\nspecified strike price. (Options are discussed in more detail in Chapter 19.)\nYou can, for example, substitute a call option for a long stock position or a put\noption for a short stock position. You realize any profits by selling the options\noutright, or you can exercise an option and take possession of the shares of stock.\nSwing traders, however, are more likely to sell the option than exercise it.\nAlthough using options as stock substitutes has several advantages, doing so also\nhas risks of its own.",

The primary advantage: An option costs far less than the\nunderlying stock, which enables you to limit your risk to the price of the option.\nEach option is a substitute for 100 shares of stock or 100 shares of an exchange-\ntraded fund (ETF). One call option, for example, gives you the ability to buy\n100 shares of a stock at a fixed price for a certain length of time. As an example,\nassume that SPTM, the S&P 1500 exchange-traded fund, is trading at $27.10 per\nshare. At the time of the example, you can buy one call option with a $27 strike\nprice for $2.26 per share, or a total of $226, before transaction costs. That one\noption enables you to buy 100 shares of SPTM for $27 before the option expires.\nSay that the option in this example has approximately six weeks before expira-\ntion. Your option position is therefore profitable as long as the SPTM exchange-\ntraded fund trades above $29.26 (excluding transaction costs) before the\nexpiration date. (We determined the break-even price by adding the $27 strike\nprice to the $2.26 cost of the option, which totals $29.26.) Your risk is the price\nof the option. In other words, you can’t lose any more than $2.26 per share, or\n$226, on this trade.\nCHAPTER 17 The Basics of Swing Trading 289",

The pre-\nceding pricing example is merely a snapshot that varies with changes in the price\nof the SPTM exchange-traded fund. The following factors affect option prices:\n» Options expire and their prices decay as the expiration date draws closer. This\nprice decay is caused by the option’s falling time value.\n» The prices of current-month options decay at faster rates than longer-dated\noptions.\n» In percentage terms, out-of-the-money options often move at a faster rate than\nin-the-money options. (An option is said to be in the money if it has intrinsic\nvalue, and it’s out of the money if it has no intrinsic value. For a call option,\nthat means the price for the underlying stock is greater than the specified\nstrike price. For a put, that means the price for the underlying stock is less\nthan the strike price. See Chapter 19 for additional details.)\n» Trading options far out of the money is rarely a good strategy.\n» Volatility is a component of option pricing. Option prices rise and fall as the\nvolatility of the stock rises and falls.\n» Except in a few unusual circumstances, an option’s price doesn’t move\nin lockstep with the underlying stock’s price.

If a stock moves $1, the option,\nin general, moves some amount less than $1. The more an option is in the\nmoney, the closer the change in an option’s price will be to the change in the\nunderlying stock’s price.\nAnother factor to consider when substituting options for stocks is that the option’s\nspread, or the difference between the bid price and the ask price, is extremely wide\nwhen considered as a percentage of the option price.\nBefore you decide to substitute options for your stock trades, make sure that you\nunderstand the option-pricing model; we discuss it in Chapter 19. And be careful\nthat you don’t overtrade with options. If you normally buy 100 shares of a stock,\nthen you need to buy only one option contract. Although the price of ten option\ncontracts may be attractive when compared with the price of the stock, ten option\ncontracts nevertheless represent 1,000 shares of stock. When buying options for\nten times the number of shares that you normally trade, you’re increasing your\nexposure to risk by a factor of ten.\nWhen trading options, you can’t make money in as many ways as you can lose it.\nBeing right on the stock’s direction but still losing money on an option trade is\npossible because of pricing issues.

Some traders are able to swing\ntrade profitably, but you need to realize that the odds are stacked against you.\nOnly you can decide whether it’s worth the effort.\nSome argue that swing trading combines the worst aspects of position trading\nwith the worst aspects of day trading. Like in day trading, swing-trading profits\nare small, and slippage costs are high.

We\nexplain more about risks in the later section “Recognizing That Risks Are High,”\nbut first we need to review some of the basic strategies that day traders use.\nTechnical needs\nNumber one on the list of things you need to become a day trader is a very good\ncomputer and Internet setup. They’re necessary for successful day trading. Most\ntraders have two or more monitors with a PC built to handle a large number of\ndata feeds at one time.\nDaily computer maintenance is critical for day traders. Computer problems are the\nlast thing you want to experience in the middle of your trading day, especially\nwhen buy positions are left open. You can lose a lot of money if you’re waiting for\nyour computer to reboot and a trade goes sour. Traders recommend that you clear\nthe cookies (files that websites send to your computer when you’re using them)\nfrom your Internet cache on a daily basis and that you defragment (reorganize your\nfiles so the computer runs more efficiently) your computer at least once a week.\nAnother key step is finding an Internet service provider (ISP) that is reliable and\noffers high-speed access to the Internet. Many traders have more than one ISP\nlined up, so they have a backup in case the first one goes down. Again, you don’t\nwant to lose even mere seconds when you’re in the middle of your trading day,\nespecially when you have open positions.\nTrading patterns\nDay traders make use of patterns seen in technical analysis similar to the ones we\ndiscuss in Part 3 of this book.",

One common pattern that day traders look for is a\nprice gap in a stock at the opening of the market. They find that prices usually\nmove in the same direction as the opening price gap during the first few minutes\nthat the market is open, and then the market tends to reverse and fill the gap (see\nChapter 10). Trading that doesn’t fill the gap during the first five to ten minutes\ncan signal a dominant trend for the day for that particular stock. Some traders\nwatch this action to find their targets for the day and the directions they plan to\nplay them. There is no consensus on this, of course. Others believe that early mar-\nket moves give false signals and that using those moves for planning your trading\nday can be dangerous.\nTraders watch for many of the same patterns they find when looking for breakout\nsignals and signs of reversals (see Chapter 10). The key difference is that a day\ntrader looks for intraday signals, whereas longer-term traders format their charts\nfor longer periods of time.\n300 PART 5 Risk-Taker’s Paradise",

The scalper’s objective is to make profits of only fractions of\na point on any given trade, rather than the several points’ profit that most traders\nseek. Day traders execute their trades in a much narrower time frame, so scalpers\nlook for only 10 to 25 cents per share, hoping to make small gains as often as\npossible. When scalping with higher-priced ($100 or more per share) or faster-\nmoving stocks, one point can be considered a scalp.\nFor most stocks, scalping doesn’t pay if you trade fewer than 1,000 shares. Here’s\nwhy: A 10-cent scalping profit on 1,000 shares is only $100 before paying trans-\naction fees or commissions. There will be little profit after fees and commissions\nif you’re trading lots with fewer than 1,000 shares.\nTrend traders\nNot all day traders use the scalping technique. Some are trend traders. Instead of\njumping into and out of a trade for a fraction of a point, they look for profits of at\nleast one or two points and may stay in a position for minutes or even as long as\nan hour. Trend traders make fewer trades than scalpers do but seek higher profits\nper trade and may trade in blocks of fewer than 1,000 shares because they can\nmake a nice profit as trend traders with considerably less share volume.",

In fact,\ntraders who look for more than a one-point profit sometimes hold a stock for\nseveral hours unless the stock is high-priced or its price is moving fast.\nRecognizing That Risks Are High\nReading about trading patterns and the high volume of stock trading, you’ve\nprobably already figured out for yourself that the risks are high. Within a matter\nof minutes, trading in and out of stocks in 1,000-share blocks can be costly when-\never a stock quickly moves in a direction you weren’t anticipating.\nIn fact, the U.S. Senate investigated the risks of day trading after a shooting spree\nat an on-site day-trading facility in Atlanta, Georgia, left nine people dead in\nJuly 1999. The shooter, Mark Barton, was a chemist before getting involved in\nday trading and losing $105,000 in just one month.

Profits went up by more than $66 million, and by 1999, the 15 firms\nhad opened 12,000 new accounts. Investigators also found that the 4,000 to 5,000\nmost active traders were borrowing huge sums of money and losing it. In that year\ntraders paid an average of $16 per trade and made an average of 29 trades per day.\nUsing these statistics, investigators concluded that a trader needed to make\nmore than $111,000 a year in stock market gains just to break even with that level\nof costs.\nA study by Ronald L. Johnson done for the North American Securities Administrators\nAssociation released in 1999 found that 70 percent of a sampling of accounts at\none trading firm lost money. He concluded that 70 percent of people who attempt\nday trading will not only lose but will also likely lose everything they initially\ndeposited in their day-trading account.

Slippage relates to the difference between what you expect your exit\nor entry stock prices to be and what you actually end up paying for and getting out\nof that stock when your order is finally executed. Depending on the volatility of\nthe market, a stock price sometimes can vary by as much as one or two points\nfrom the time you see the stock quotation until the time your order is actually\nexecuted.\nTraders can control slippage with the right type of order.

We discuss types of orders\nin Chapter 2.\nMost traders recommend that you never enter a position without immediately\nplacing a stop-loss order at an exit price that you decide is the most you’re willing\nto lose on a particular position. Although a stop order means that once a stock\nhits the exit price, the order changes to a market order and may result in your\nselling the stock at less than that price, it nevertheless is safer than placing a limit\norder, which can mean that you miss the exit point altogether and possibly lose\neven more. Stop-loss orders can cause some slippage, but you usually lose less\nwith these types of orders than with limit orders. A limit order can be completely\nmissed when your stock breaks into a downward trend because the fall in price\nwas too abrupt or rapid for it to be executed.\nWhen buying stock, traders use limit orders because they place limits on the entry\nprices traders are willing to pay. Traders certainly don’t want to end up paying\nhigher prices than they intend, which, in turn, raises the bar for making a profit\nhigher than is reasonably possible to attain.\nTrading costs\nMany of the day-trading firms set a per-share cost for stock trades or a per-trade\ncost. Per-trade costs vary from $0.00 to $9.99 per trade depending on how much\ntrading you do in a month.",

Per-trade costs vary from $0.00 to $9.99 per trade depending on how much\ntrading you do in a month. In addition, you may be charged a fee for routing as\nwell as for the trading platform provided.\nCost of trading is the same whether you have Level I or Level II access (see\nChapter 3 for information on Level I and Level II quoting alternatives). The num-\nber of trades you do impacts whether you have to pay for Level II access. To get\nLevel II access for free, your broker will set a minimum number of trades you\nmust make per month; otherwise, the monthly fee for Level II access can be\n$150 or higher. Options-trading fees vary by broker as well.\nIn addition to these fees, per-share charges can range from $0.005 per share to\n$0.01 per share, depending on the exchange on which you choose to trade. If your\ncomputer crashes or your Internet access goes down, phone orders can cost you\n$15 or more per trade.\nSo if you trade 30 times a day for 20 days a month, the number of your trades\ntotals 600. At $4.95 per trade, your commission costs are $2,970 per month, and\nif you trade 1,000 shares with each trade, that adds up to a total of 600,000 shares\nper month. Even at the lowest per-share exchange cost of $0.005, that means an\nadditional $3,000 in per-share charges. Thus, your monthly cost for this volume\nof trading would be $5,970.

These ser-\nvices can add another $200 to $250 to your monthly costs. So before you see even\none penny of profit, your monthly outlay can be $6,000 or more (that’s $72,000\nannually or more). You can easily understand why so many day traders never see\na profit for at least six months and why such a high percentage of day traders\nactually give up before their businesses turn profitable.\nTaxes (of course)\nOn top of all these costs, you must consider taxes that you’ll have to pay on any\nshort-term profits at your current individual tax rate and not the preferred tax\nrates given to long-term investments held more than a year. However, full-time\nday traders have tax advantages that other traders and investors don’t have,\nprovided that they meet the following qualifications:\n» Buy and sell a high volume of stocks every day. If you’re day trading full\ntime, proving that you’re meeting the requirements to qualify for the special\nday-trading tax breaks is easier.

Here are some of the\nmore serious mistakes new day traders make:\n» Breaking stop-loss rules: When a stock starts dropping, newer, not-yet-\ndisciplined traders tend to panic as their picks begin losing money, so they\ndecide to hold the stock rather than exit when their initial stop-loss is reached.\nHowever, traders go broke using that strategy because they don’t stop their\nlosses as planned.",

Follow\nthose rules mechanically when the target price is hit, and don’t let your\nemotions get in the way.\n» Chasing trends: New traders who aren’t yet confident in the way they read\npatterns often wait to see confirmation that they’re right before they enter\na position. That hesitation causes them to miss planned entry points and, if\nthey’re right, can end up forcing them into buying at a stock price that’s higher\nthan they intended when an upward trend is expected or selling at a lower\nprice than they intended when a downward trend is expected.

Experienced traders know to wait for the right timing instead of\nforcing a trade, entering at the wrong price, and overtrading their account.\n» Not establishing set rules before the trading day begins: To avoid getting\ncaught up in the emotions of a big win or loss, you need to decide your entry\nand exit points before the trading day begins and never deviate from them\nafter the day begins.

Day traders must follow market signs and not worry\nabout how good or bad the fundamentals of the company they’re trading\nmay appear.\n» Averaging down: Although investors may average down, meaning they buy a\nstock, and if the price goes down, they buy even more shares, believing that\nit’s a good stock that will recover, this technique doesn’t work for day traders.\nMost experienced traders of every variety will tell you that using it is a fatal\nmistake. Day traders instead believe that you need to set a stop price and get\nout (called stopping out) of a losing stock and possibly reenter again at a lower\nprice. Doing so gives you time to look objectively at what is happening with\nthe stock and determine whether getting back in is worthwhile. Stopping out\nalso is likely to cost you less than averaging down, and you won’t risk getting\ncaught with a margin problem. Averaging down can tie up too much money\nthat you can otherwise use for a more profitable trade with a different stock.\nThe worst feeling, even for an experienced trader, occurs when a stock\nplunges far below the stop position because deciding whether to take the\nlarge loss is difficult. In most cases, if you’re uncertain of your next move,\nexperienced traders recommend that you get out of the position before the\nsituation grows worse or out of control.\n» Not knowing when to take profits: New traders sometimes make the\nmistake of either taking profits too early or not taking profits at all. Both can\nresult in unnecessary losses. Most of the time, indecision strikes when traders\nare afraid they’ll lose a profit if they hold it too long or miss a profit if they exit\ntoo soon.

This underlier is usually stocks, bonds, foreign currency, or commodi-\nties. The derivative buyer or seller doesn’t have to own the underlying security to\ntrade these instruments.\nYou may unwittingly encounter derivatives if you trade those exchange-traded\nfunds (ETFs) that offer to return two or even three times the value of an underly-\ning stock index. Those ETFs use derivatives to amplify the reward — and the risk.\nAnd you may recall that derivative trading, especially those derivatives tied to the\nvalue of underlying mortgage assets, exacerbated the mortgage mess that started\nthe financial collapse of 2008.\nDerivatives traders use futures and options, which are the two most common\ntypes of derivatives, to make money in a highly risky venture. In this chapter, we\nintroduce you to a variety of derivatives, how they’re traded, and the risks involved\nin trading futures and options.

Trading a derivative, for example, can minimize your financial loss when-\never a major change occurs in the price of an asset that you own. Hedging is a\npopular tactic used by growers, producers, portfolio managers, and users of the\ncommodities.\nThe two basic and most common types of derivatives are contracts for options and\nfor futures. Traders buy and sell them as a way to speculate on the direction that\nthe volatile prices of underlying assets will take further down the road. If their\nhunches are right and the prices move in the directions they expect, traders can\nmake a significant profit. If, on the other hand, they’re wrong, they can lose the\namount they paid for an option or future and possibly even quite a bit more. Before\nwe explain all the risks, we devote the next few sections to accurately defining\nfutures and options.\nBuy now, pay later: Futures\nFutures are legally binding contracts between two parties, one of whom agrees to\nbuy and the other who agrees to sell an asset for a specific price at a specified time\nin the future. The specific price is known as the futures price.",

The specific price is known as the futures price. The specified date in\nthe future is known as the delivery date. Futures were first used in the 18th century\nin Japan as a means of trading rice and silk, but they didn’t appear in U.S. markets\nuntil the 1850s, when futures markets were developed for buying and selling com-\nmodities such as wheat, cotton, and corn.\nFutures contracts are one of the most volatile trading instruments. Prices can\nchange rapidly, causing traders to face sudden and sometimes huge losses or\ngains. Futures contracts are traded based on the prices of underlying commodi-\nties, indexes, bonds, and stocks. Most people who enter futures markets do so\nnot to actually buy and sell the actual goods or underlying financial asset but\nrather to speculate on or to hedge the risks of the changing prices of the assets\nthat they do hold.\nFutures contracts are riskier than options because you actually have to come up\nwith the underlying commodity, bond, stock, or currency to satisfy the contract,\nsell the future at a loss before the settlement date, or pay the difference in cash to\nsettle the contract.

Options are less risky because they’re not an\nobligation to perform. Rather, they give the buyer of the option the right to exer-\ncise the option, but the buyer isn’t obligated to do so. We explain options in the\nlater section “Wait and see: Options.”\nWhat’s your position?\nWhen people talk about futures, they’re bound to say something about their posi-\ntions. Here’s what they mean:\n» Short positions: The party in the contract who agrees to deliver the\ncommodity, stock, or bond holds a short position. Traders who take short\npositions are expecting the price of the underlying commodities to go down.\n» Long positions: The party in the contract who agrees to buy the commodity,\nstock, or bond in a futures contract holds a long position on the security.\nTraders who take long positions are expecting the price of the underlying\ncommodities to go up.\nMaking money using futures\nTraders can make money from trading futures on the basis of the daily move-\nments of the markets for the various types of underlying commodities, stocks,\nbonds, or currencies involved in the contracts they buy and/or sell.\nFor example, typical futures contracts for wheat are signed between wheat farm-\ners and bread producers. On one side of this contract, farmers agree to sell a spe-\ncific amount of the wheat they grow at a specific price and a specified time, and\non the other side, producers agree to pay that price for the contracted amount of\nwheat to be delivered to them by the specified time.",

Assuming the farmer agreed in\nFebruary to sell 10,000 bushels of wheat to the bread maker at $4 per bushel in\nJuly, and assuming that before the July settlement date the price of wheat rises\nto $5 per bushel, the farmer holding the futures contract has lost $1 per bushel of\nwheat, or $10,000. These types of price adjustments actually are calculated\ndaily throughout the time that the futures contract is in force, and that means\nthe farmer’s or bread maker’s account is credited or debited as wheat prices\nfluctuate.\nCHAPTER 19 Doing It by Derivatives 311",

Instead, the obligations of the futures contract eventually are settled\nwith cash. In this scenario, the bread maker will probably buy his wheat at the\ncurrent price of $5 per bushel when he needs it, but because he speculated cor-\nrectly on the price, it’s only really costing him $40,000 (rather than $50,000 at\nthe current market price) to buy the wheat. Although the bread maker pays\n$50,000 for 10,000 bushels of wheat, he has saved $10,000 because of the money\nhe made on the wheat futures contract. The farmer, on the other hand, sells his\nwheat at $5 per bushel and gets $50,000 cash but actually keeps only $40,000\nbecause he has to cover his loss from the futures contract.\nYou can see from this example that futures contracts are actually financial posi-\ntions. This financial position, or the buying and selling of futures contracts, is\nwhat traders are speculating about. If futures traders believe the price of wheat is\nrising, they buy futures contracts so they can benefit from the gain made by the\nprice. But when the situation is reversed and the price of wheat drops to $3 per\nbushel, then the trader who buys can be on the losing side of that futures contract\nand be liable for a $10,000 loss.",

The buyer puts up a margin, which is only a small\npercentage of the price of the actual commodity, stock, bond, or currency under-\nlying the contract.\nCommodities futures\nPeople who buy commodities futures basically are agreeing to buy a certain\namount of a commodity at a set price at some point in the future. Conversely,\npeople who sell those same futures are agreeing to provide a certain amount of a\ncommodity at the agreed-upon price by the agreed-upon time. The example of the\nfarmer/bread maker in the preceding section illustrates this type of future. Buyers\nor sellers can enter into futures contracts on many commodities, including farm\nproducts (pork bellies, wheat, corn, and soybeans), precious metals (gold, copper,\nand silver), and many others.\nTraders usually don’t get directly involved as buyers and sellers of the actual\ncommodities because they usually get out of their futures contracts before the\nunderlying commodities on which their trades are based ever change hands.\nInstead, they’re speculators, buying and/or selling futures contracts based on\nwhich way they think the commodity price is going to move. Speculation, as you\nknow, is wrought with risk, and the reason the risk is so great is that a commodity\ncontract controls a large amount of the commodity (or commodity value) com-\npared with the relatively small margin that it takes to enter into a contract. The\nresult is extensive leverage, which means controlling a large position with only a\nsmall cash deposit. If the price moves in a direction that’s the opposite of what the\ntrader anticipates, they may have to take a huge loss to get out of the contract.\n312 PART 5 Risk-Taker’s Paradise",

They can be\nthe riskiest types of futures. No underlying commodities, stocks, or bonds ever\nchange hands with these futures contracts. Any differences in these contracts\nmust be settled with good old cold, hard cash. Margin also is high on these types\nof futures. For example, a Dow Jones Industrial Average contract has a value\nthat’s 25 times the value of the underlying DJIA Index.\nSmaller index futures contracts, known collectively as e-minis, are targeted at\nindividual traders. These mini contracts are available for indexes such as the S&P\n500, the NASDAQ 100, the S&P mid-cap, and the Russell 2000. Their respective\nindividual values range from 20 times to 100 times those of the underlying indexes.\nThe S&P 500 e-mini contract, for example, is 50 times the value of the S&P 500\nindex. In other words, if a trader takes a position in the S&P 500 e-mini contract,\nevery time the underlying S&P 500 index moves one point, the value of the\nS&P 500 e-mini contract changes by $50. Another way to think about this is for\nevery 0.25 point, the value of the S&P 500 e-mini contract changes by $12.50.

Speculators\nbasically are betting on whether the price of that bond goes up or down. Changes\nin interest rates have a big impact on bond values. In general, when interest rates\nfall, bond prices go up, and when interest rates rise, bond prices go down.\nSpeculators in bond futures basically enter positions based on whether interest\nrates will go up or down. For example, a speculator who thinks interest rates will\ngo up sells contracts for the future delivery of bonds. If interest rates indeed go up\nas expected, the price for the underlying bonds goes down, and speculators can do\none of two things:\n» Buy the lower-priced bonds and, in turn, earn a profit by selling them to the\nbuyer to settle at the higher price named in the original futures contract.\n» Close the contract to realize a profit.\nCHAPTER 19 Doing It by Derivatives 313",

For example, a trader who enters into a con-\ntract to buy 100 shares at $30 a share for a total of $3,000, and who expects the\nprice of that stock to go up, can lock in the lower price and then buy the actual\nstock at that lower price on the expiration date or close the contract and realize a\nprofit.

The big advan-\ntage that options have over futures is that you buy the right to exercise the option\ncontract, and yet you still can decide to allow the option to expire without ever\nexercising that right. When you let an option expire, you lose only the amount you\npaid for the option and not the full amount that otherwise can be lost in trading\nthe underlying asset.

This person or financial entity must come up with the underly-\ning asset promised in the option, even if doing so means a loss, whenever an\noption buyer decides to exercise an option. For example, if an option grantor\nagrees to sell you 100 shares of ABC stock for $50 per share on or before\nMay 1, and the stock price rises to $60 on April 20, then the grantor must\nsell you that stock for $50 and take the $10-per-share loss.

Options traders selling covered calls are\ntrying to take advantage of a neutral or declining stock. If the option expires\nunexercised, the writer (seller) of the option keeps the premium. If, on the\nother hand, the holder (buyer) of the option exercises it, the stock must be\ndelivered. However, because the option writer already owns the stock, the risk\nis limited.

The seller of an uncovered call is\ntaking virtually unlimited risk.\n» Covered puts: When the seller of a put option also has sold short an\nequivalent amount in the underlying security, then this option is considered\na covered put. If the writer has neither established a short position in the\nunderlying security nor deposited a corresponding amount of cash equal to\nthe value of the put, then the put is called a naked put.

The most an\noption holder can lose is the amount paid for the option contract.\n» Underlying asset: An option contract is based on an underlying asset —\nusually either a futures contract or specific number of shares of stock — that\ncan be bought or sold.\n» Premium: The actual price paid for the option is called the premium, which\nis what the option holder pays to the option grantor to gain the right to either\nbuy or sell the underlying asset. Premiums for options are set by the open\nmarket. Option buyers must pay the premium plus whatever fees their\nbrokers charge for such transactions.\n» Expiration date: The expiration date is the last day that an option buyer\ncan exercise the rights specified in the contract.

Exercising a put option means\nthe option buyer sells the underlying asset at the price set in the option.\nOption buyers can always decide not to exercise the rights set forth in their\noption and simply let it expire. Option holders can also sell the option\ncontract at its current market value.\n» Strike price: The strike price is the price of the underlying asset at which the\noption can be exercised.\n» Offset: If option buyers or sellers want to realize their profits or limit their\nlosses, they can offset their option through a sale or purchase called liquidating\nan option or closing an option.

The premium for an in-the-money call option, on the other hand,\nrises in value if the underlying asset moves further into the money in relation-\nship to the strike price.\n» Volatility: The more volatility that’s expected by the market for the underlying\nasset, or stock, the greater the chance that the option will become worthwhile\nto exercise.

Therefore, instead of having to own 100 shares of these\nhigher-priced stocks, you can buy options when you hold just 10 shares.\nThe basics of trading these mini-options contracts are similar to the 100-share con-\ntracts, but they enable smaller investors to trade options on these higher-priced shares\nwithout as large of an initial investment.

If you’re a U.S. citizen shopping in England, and you see a sweater that\nyou want for £100 (100 pounds — the pound is the name of the basic unit of cur-\nrency in Great Britain), you’ll need to know the exchange rate. In November 2022,\nfor example, the rate was $1.1391382 U.S. for £1 (one pound). So a £100 sweater\nwould cost you $139.13 in U.S. dollars.\nWe include this example here to show you how Forex is used by the average\nshopper, but foreign currency traders trade much larger sums of money thousands\nof times a day. The majority of trades take place in five countries: the United\nKingdom, the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan.

Forex traders who speculate on the values of currencies to earn\ntheir keep look for specific signs to indicate when exchange rates may change,\nincluding the following:\n» Political instability: Unrest in a country drives up demand for currency in\nsafer markets, such as U.S. dollars, as speculators race to find safe havens.\n» Rising interest rates: Higher interest rates encourage foreign investments in\ncountries where native investors are seeking better rates of return than they\ncan get at home.\n» Economic reforms: Economic reforms in developing countries may help\nimprove their currencies.",

Currencies of developing countries are softest, usually facing\nlower demand than the currencies of developed countries. Soft currencies at times\ncan be difficult to convert.\nUnderstanding Money Jargon\nThe world of Forex has a language of its own. Prices are quoted two ways, mean-\ning that when traders talk price with each other, they state their respective prices\nin terms of what exchange rate they’ll pay to buy the currency and what they’ll take\nwhen selling it. Bid and ask price differences, or spreads, usually are stated in pips,\nor a small fraction of a currency unit.\nPips are the most common incremental price movement quoted in the currency\nmarket. Some brokers quote in an even smaller measurement called pipettes.\nAlthough most transactions deal in thousands (individuals) or millions (interbank)\nof dollars, yen, euro, or other currencies, and a pip spread can equal thousands of\ndollars, most currency price quotes nevertheless are extended out four decimals\n(1.5432, for example).

Many times traders quote\nonly the last two digits, or the small numbers (such as 32 exchange for 22), because\nthe incremental changes are so small that only the last two digits matter.\nAs a trader, you need to think in terms of the host currency when receiving a quote\nfor direct exchange, which is an exchange based on the value of the host country’s\ncurrency. For example, quotes given to traders on the CME Group (formerly three\nseparate exchanges: Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, and\nNYMEX) are based on the U.S. dollar because it’s the host currency for the CME\nGroup. You can see how that exchange works at cmegroup.com. Quotes for indirect\nexchange are just the opposite. They’re based on the foreign currency for which\nyou’re seeking a trade rather than on the host currency. For example, if you’re in\nthe United States and receive an indirect price quote, you’d be getting a price\nbased on buying a set amount of foreign currency in exchange for U.S. dollars.\nMost exchanges take place on the interbank market — currency exchanges among\nthe world’s banks — and are based on the U.S. dollar.\nTraders use three different types of trades to exchange currency.

These transactions usually start with one trader contacting\nanother and asking for a price on a particular type of currency without specifying\nwhether they want to buy or sell.

A buyer and a seller set an exchange rate for the\ntransaction, and the transaction occurs at the set price at the appointed time,\nregardless of what the current market price is for the currencies.

They can, instead, simply decide to let it expire.\nOption buyers have to pay for the right to buy or sell these transactions on or\nbefore a specified date. The set price at which the currencies are exchanged is\ncalled the strike price. When the date for the exchange arrives, the option holder\ndetermines whether the strike price is favorable. If it is, the option owner com-\npletes the transaction and earns a profit, but if it isn’t favorable, the option owner\nallows the option to expire and absorbs the cost of purchasing the original option,\nwhich is less of a loss than actually exchanging the currencies.

Clearinghouses for futures are efficient, and\nfutures transactions usually are cleared hourly or in some cases even minute\nby minute.\nGetting Ready to Trade Money\nYour first step as a foreign currency trader is to develop an extensive collection of\nhistorical information not only about rate fluctuations for the currencies you plan\nto trade but also about interest-rate fluctuations, economic history, and political\nstability of the countries whose currencies you’re considering.

Set your risk limits before you start so you don’t get\nemotionally caught up in having to make these potentially disastrous trading\ndecisions on the fly. Capital that you risk on Forex trading needs to be money that\nyou can afford to lose without impacting your lifestyle. Do not, for any reason, use\nretirement savings, savings for your children’s educations, or savings required to\nmaintain your house and lifestyle.\nAs is true for stock trading, when trading currencies, you need to develop a plan\nthat determines what you trade and how much you’re at risk. When your plan is\nin place, you need to stick to it for the entire trading day. You should not be devel-\noping the plan and executing it at the same time. Foreign currency trading requires\na great deal of focus, and you can’t risk breaking that focus to do additional plan-\nning in the middle of a trading day. Monitor the successes you have in meeting the\ngoals of your plan.

We offer suggestions for helping\nyou recognize the mistakes and for avoiding and even correcting them.\nFishing for Bottoms\nBottom fishing — trying to catch a stock as it bottoms out — is a great way to get\nsoaked and lose a bucketful of money. In a bear market, stocks get much cheaper\nthan most people ever expect or want. They don’t stop falling until they’ve run out\nof gas.\nThe psychology of a bear market is perverse. As long as traders remain interested\nin a stock, many are the moments when it seems like the stock may recover. The\nthing is, stocks rarely turn on a dime and head higher. Only after the momentum\ncrowd loses interest does the stock’s downward price slide end. When value inves-\ntors, who can’t resist a bargain, begin nibbling, the stock begins to stabilize;\nhowever, it also may spend a very long time bouncing around in a trading range.\nCHAPTER 21 More Than Ten Huge Trading Mistakes 345",

Your best opportunity for profit occurs when the stock breaks out of its\ntrading range. Chapter 9 shows how to identify these trading-range breakout pat-\nterns. Instead of risking your trading capital on unreliable bottoming patterns,\nwait until you’re sure.\nTiming the Top\nTops and bottoms share something in common: They rarely arrive when they’re\nsupposed to. When traders and investors are exuberant, they keep buying even\nafter doing so no longer makes fundamental sense. That’s why shorting a stock\nthat’s trending higher makes no sense, even if its price is far beyond reasonable.\nYou don’t have to have a lengthy memory or an encyclopedic knowledge of stock\nmarket history to remember what happened to Internet stocks in the late 1990s.\nThose were heady days. Stocks went in only one direction — up. Some of those\nmagically levitating companies had modest revenues, but few had earnings.\nNevertheless, traders bid hundreds of dollars per share for some worthless junk.\nJust like the housing bubble of the early 2000s, Internet stocks were a case of mass\nhysteria, mob mentality, market madness, or all three.\nCall it what you will, but when a bubble is inflating, you definitely don’t want to\nshort related stocks. Sure, these stocks eventually crashed and burned, but not\nbefore depleting the trading accounts of a den full of bearish short sellers. Don’t\nguess.",

Sure, these stocks eventually crashed and burned, but not\nbefore depleting the trading accounts of a den full of bearish short sellers. Don’t\nguess. Wait for reliable trading signals, like the ones discussed in Chapters 9\nand 10, before entering a position.\nYou may be asking whether there were reliable trading signals before the Internet\nbubble burst. There weren’t before; traders aren’t fortunetellers (see Chapter 8).\nHowever, the risks at the time were well-known. And when stocks began heading\nlower early in 2000, you had all the information you needed to protect your profits\nand trading capital and begin selling short. The signals were also there in early\n2008 that the market was set for another fall. Chapter 13 uses the NASDAQ bubble\nas an example to show how to evaluate market risk and adjust your trading strat-\negy as the market transitions from a rising to a falling market.\nTrading against the Dominant Trend\nTrading against the dominant trend in the market leads to costly mistakes.\nUnfortunately, misidentifying the trend by focusing on the chart in front of you\nand forgetting to look at the next higher-level chart is an easy thing to do.

But on\nthe daily chart, the trend you saw on the intraday chart actually turns out to be a\nconsolidation rally during a strong downtrend. The promising pullback actually is\nthe beginning of the next leg down on the daily chart. If you buy long in a situation\nlike this one, hoping to capture the next leg up, your position will be swamped\n(and so will your trading capital) by the flood of sell orders coming from traders\nwho recognize the implications of the stronger, longer-term trend.\nRegardless of the specific indications of the chart you’re looking at, always con-\nfirm your analysis by looking at charts one time period higher. For example, if\nyou’re studying daily charts, confirm your analysis on the weekly charts. If you’re\nstudying intraday charts, confirm your analysis on the daily charts. Always know\nwhich part of the market cycle you’re in and what types of industries excel in that\npart of the cycle. See Chapters 10 and 13 for additional information.\nDon’t try to buy long based on a brief intraday move when the dominant trend on\nthe daily charts is down. Doing so is a great way of giving up your trading capital\nto someone else.\nWinging It\nTraders get into big trouble when they wing it.

A bad trade may reduce your net worth, but it shouldn’t\ndamage your self-esteem. Entering a losing trade certainly doesn’t mean that\nyou’re a nincompoop or blockhead — any more than closing a winning trade\nsignals your brilliance and mastery of all you survey.\nThe market isn’t out to get you; it’s out to get your money. Don’t take trading\npersonally. A losing trade is just another losing trade. You’ll have plenty of them.\nGet used to it.\nFalling in Love\nTrading is a business; and your stocks are your inventory. Smart business owners\ndon’t fall in love with their inventory. It’s there to sell at a profit if possible, or at\na loss if necessary. And smart businesspeople don’t fall in love with their business\nmodels. If it isn’t working, they change it; otherwise, they’ll be out of business\nbefore you can say “liquidation sale.”\nWhen you fall in love with your stock, you risk large losses. When you fall in love\nwith your trading plan, you risk many more losses. It’s easy to fall in love. After\ndoing hours of research and analysis, you want to be right. You want your trades\nand your trading plans to generate profits, but hoping doesn’t make it so.\nBe smart. Don’t fall in love.

You’re likely to pay considerably more to buy a\nstock that you want or to sell one for considerably less than you’d planned.

Chapter 15 discusses the\nmechanics of entering these types of orders.\nChasing a Runaway Trend\nIf you miss the breakout entry point for a stock that you want, waiting is better\nthan entering a position as a trend accelerates. See Chapter 10 for information\nabout identifying and trading a trend. Often, stocks will pull back and test the\nbreakout point. Wait for that point, or wait for the stock to take a short breather\nafter its first leg up. If you’re still interested, that’s a better entry point than chas-\ning a stock as it accelerates into the trend. Like a fine wine, you sometimes need\nto let a stock breathe.\nOn the other hand, if you already have a position in a runaway stock, try planning\nyour exit so you leave a little money on the table. Capturing every last nickel of the\ntrend is almost impossible, anyway, so don’t try. Instead, consider trimming your\nposition as the stock reaches for the stratosphere. If you’re using margin, consider\ntaking some profit off the table and reducing your leverage a bit. We discuss this\nstrategy further in Chapter 13, and the mechanics of using margin are covered in\nChapter 15. When a runaway stock stops going up and everyone wants out at the\nsame time, the speed at which the price falls is remarkable. Be ready to jettison\nstocks that rally too fast at the first sign of trouble.\nAveraging Down\nAveraging down is a below-average idea.",

You sometimes hear advisors suggesting\nit as a way of reducing your cost basis, but it’s merely a technique to throw good\nmoney after bad. The logic of averaging down is completely contrary to the logic\nof trading. Traders sell losers. They don’t reward them with infusions of trading\ncapital.\nHowever, averaging up makes some sense. Traders call it pyramiding. The idea is\nto add to your winning positions when your trading system triggers new trading\nsignals in the direction of the trend. Pyramiding is a good way of building a large\nposition in a strongly trending stock. Be aware of the risk, though. The larger your\nposition, the more it hurts when the trend ends and the stock’s price begins to fall.\nBe ready to trim your pyramid position at the first sign of trouble.\nCHAPTER 21 More Than Ten Huge Trading Mistakes 349",

You’ll be\ntempted when a trade goes against you. You’ll look at your indicators and the\nsupport levels on your charts, and you’ll be certain that the stock will soon stop\nfalling. When you start thinking you want to give a position a little room to work\nits way out of losing territory, you’re on your way toward a trading debacle. It’s\nwishful thinking, it’s hoping against hope, and it’s a good way to lose a lot of\nmoney. Unless you’re omniscient, close the position when the price hits your stop.\nTake your loss. Chapter 15 discusses stop orders and how to use them.\nDiversifying Badly\nExposing all your capital in one trade is a bad idea, and so is trading hundreds of\nstocks simultaneously. You can find a happy medium somewhere in between.\nYou can monitor only so many positions and do it well. You need only so many\npositions to diversify your risk. And although you can have too few or too\nmany stocks in your trading portfolio, no perfect number — one that is right for\nevery trader — exists. That said, you nevertheless have to figure out what the\nright number is for you. Start with 10 or 15 positions. You may end up deciding\nthat 8 are enough. However, unless you have an extremely large portfolio, we\ncan’t imagine why you’d need any more than 20 positions.\nThe simple wisdom is this: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.",

No matter how good your trading system is, no matter how\nexperienced you are, and no matter which stocks you pick, you’re going to have\nlosing trades. Your success as a trader depends on how you handle those losing\ntrades. If you dispose of the losers quickly, you can become a very successful\ntrader.

Although they can’t predict the future, they nevertheless help\nyou understand the past so you can more effectively extrapolate what may happen\nto a stock in the future.\nTraders use many different types of moving averages in hundreds of different\nways. Stock closing prices are the most common data being averaged, but any\nvalue on a price chart can be smoothed for interpretation. For example, traders\nsometimes manipulate the moving averages by using the midpoint between the\nhigh and low prices to develop the moving average. Others look for the moving\naverage using the open, high, or low price. It’s all a matter of trading style and\nhow the charts you’re developing match your trading system.\nBe sure to find out how to use moving averages and what they mean. After you\nunderstand them and what goes into them, you can manipulate moving averages\nto your advantage and to coincide with your trading style. Moving averages are\npowerful indicators, but they’re not the only type of indicator you need to use in\nchoosing your trades; use moving averages in conjunction with other indicators.\nFor more information, see Chapter 11.\nCHAPTER 22 Ten Trading Survival Techniques 355",

A trading system is such a map because it’s developed using a collection of\ntools created from technical and fundamental analyses woven together to let you\nknow when it’s time to enter or exit positions. You can buy trading systems off the\nshelf, but these systems are available to thousands of others who ultimately will\nend up with the same buy and sell signals.\nTo be able to trade outside the pack, you need to develop your own trading system,\nusing your own favorite tools. Although you can use tools provided in off-the-\nshelf software packages, you want to develop and adapt a trading system that fits\nuniquely with your personality and trading objectives.\nAfter initially developing and testing your own trading system, your work isn’t\nfinished. You’ll need to constantly monitor your system’s successes and failures\nand look for ways to make improvements. For more information, see Chapter 16.\nKnow Your Costs\nTrading isn’t cheap. Not only do you have to worry about commissions or trans-\naction fees, but you also must watch for any slippage in your trades. Even though\nyou may be using stop or limit orders, you rarely end up executing trades at the\nexact entry or exit prices you plan.",

Even though\nyou may be using stop or limit orders, you rarely end up executing trades at the\nexact entry or exit prices you plan. Some slippage, or the difference between the\nquoted price and the actual price for the security, is bound to occur, so be sure that\nyou carefully monitor your commission costs, transaction fees, and slippage costs.\nIn addition, don’t forget to consider the tax man. If you’re trading stocks that you\nhold for less than a year, any profits you make are taxed as current income instead\nof at lower capital-gains tax rates.\nTraders must also avoid being caught by wash sale rules. Most trading losses can\nbe used to offset trading gains and thus reduce your income tax burden, but if you\nsell a stock for a loss and repurchase the same stock within 30 days, you can’t\ndeduct your trading loss for that transaction. You have to wait until you sell the\nstock again and use any losses to reduce the cost basis of the trade, which reduces\nthe tax owed when the position is finally closed. Full-time day traders receive\nspecial tax treatment, but you must be a bona fide day trader to qualify. For more\ninformation, see Chapters 2 and 15.\n356 PART 6 The Part of Tens",

All too often you’re enticed by the win and want to\nride it to the absolute top.\nWise traders plan their exit points at the top and bottom of each position long\nbefore they ever enter that position. And more importantly, they stick to their\nplan. Getting caught up in the emotions of a winning trade is easy, but don’t for-\nget you’re operating a business. Take your profits when you reach your goal and\nget out so you don’t risk turning a winning position into a loss.\nWhen you make a mistake, own up to it quickly, take your hit, and get out of the\nposition. If the stock recovers, you can always reenter the position at a later time.\nDon’t ride a stock to the bottom just to try to prove you were right. Plan your exit\npoints before you buy and stick to them. For more information, see Chapter 12.\nWatch for Signals, Don’t Anticipate Them\nAfter you make a decision to buy a stock, you may find that you’re impatient to\nactually get into that position. You start watching the charts and waiting for the\nright signal to buy. Often, you’ll see charts move close to your planned signal but\nnot actually reach it.\nBe patient. Wait for the signal you’ve designated in your plan. Don’t anticipate any\nmoves, even if the stock price is getting close to that point on your charts. You\nmay miss the perfect entry point, but you’ll be less likely to make that fatal\nmistake of entering a position before the signal is triggered only to see your\nstock reverse course and thus be forced to take a loss. For more information, see\nChapters 10 and 13.\nBuy on Strength, Sell on Weakness\nBuy on strength and sell on weakness is a mantra you’ve probably heard frequently\nfrom investment and trading gurus. The reason for its popularity is a good one: It\nworks! And it needs to become your trading way of life.\nCHAPTER 22 Ten Trading Survival Techniques 357",

When you see a stock falling and showing signs of entering a weakening\nperiod, it’s time to sell. If a weak stock takes a turn for the better, you can always\nreenter the position. For more information, see Chapter 13.\nKeep a Trading Journal and Review It Often\nThe only way you can ever improve your trading skills is by keeping track of what\nworks and what doesn’t and trying to gauge why. After each trade, write down the\ndetails of the trade and what went right and/or wrong with that trade. You can\nonly improve what you measure, so measure everything and put it in your trading\njournal.\nDon’t forget to review the contents of your journal every week. You may find that\nreviewing your successes is enjoyable but reviewing your failures is difficult.\nFailure, however, sometimes is the best teacher. Many people discover more from\ntheir failures than from their successes. Try figuring out why your failed trades\ndidn’t work and what you could’ve done to improve your results. Of course, don’t\nignore your successes. After all, you need to know what works and why and then\ntry to incorporate those winning strategies more consistently into your trading\nsystem.
